As a result of our work with our partners in the international VISA and local ArCa payment system, we were able to register this result. Visa Token service is already operating in Armenia and it has been introduced in the new mobile application of ACBA Bank. We are creating a new culture of contactless payments,” said ACBA Bank CEO Hakob Andreasyan.\n\"Today we are launching a new technology in Armenia - tokenization, without which the further full development of the country's payment ecosystem is impossible.

Every second transaction with Visa cards in Armenian shops is now performed contactless. During the quarantine, the number of contactless transactions in Armenia almost doubled.

        "title_en": "The Crisis as a New Opportunity for Business Development",
        "content_en": "From the beginning of 2020, the difficulties caused by the coronavirus set new rules for business. In many cases, the created difficulties can be the new start and beginning of new opportunities for businesses. What was the situation like in the Armenian business sector at the beginning and during the epidemic and what can we expect in the future, as well as about new opportunities created through state-funded programs. We talked about these and other business topics with Arsen Melkonyan, the Deputy CEO Business Operations Coordination of ACBA Bank. \n- What was the situation in the Armenian business sector at the beginning of the epidemic?\n- Initially we were dealing with some confusion, which, I think, was due to lack of information. The business was at unawares, but after a while the adaptation phase began. During this crisis, the main guarantees and tools for the continuous provision of normal business activities were identified and highlighted: organization of remote work, new security rules, definition of other rules of conduct to organize the work process accurately, etc. All this greatly helped to stabilize the situation. These behavioral changes manifested in everyone – the employers, the employees and the customers. \n - What is the current situation in the Armenian business sector?\n- In this situation, we can conditionally divide the business into three large groups.\nThe first large group includes companies that are not currently operating. For example, hotels, the activities of which are mainly due to external tourism. At this stage, I think it is unrealistic to expect these organizations to be active.\nThe second group – the enterprises, businesses, which have a certain decline compared to the past, but the current activity in this situation allows them to ensure some stability.\nAnd the third group – businesses that have not been affected by the coronavirus and have also seen some growth. We are talking about the enterprises that did not have and do not have a sales problem. They even registered growth rates. And, of course, these businesses have a very good opportunity to grow. \n- About state-supported programs. What role did these programs play in the current situation? What opportunities do businesses get?\n- State-supported programs have played a cornerstone role in stabilizing the situation. But it is important to note that these plans were not a lifeline. In general, all companies have suffered from the coronavirus, and we consider these programs as a good opportunity for business growth and development and, why not, for crediting at a substantially good interest rate of 0%, which under normal circumstances, we understand that it was impossible. Businesses should try to look at this opportunity not from the position of the affected organization, but consider these programs as a new opportunity to develop and re-profile.\n - What can we expect in the future?\n- We can happily state that in this difficult situation we have partners who have not only been able to ensure stability, but also to expand, establish and develop their activities. It is very important for the economy of our country to develop the adaptation capabilities of the business sector in possible new situations. For example, flexibility is needed in business transformation opportunities to become digital. We, in our turn, in the past and now, are ready to move forward step by step or with big leaps with our partners.\nACBA Bank has proved for many times the fact that it stands firmly by its partners. From the first day of the crisis, we have responded intensively, most importantly, with an individualized approach to the problems faced by all our partners. We have used a wide range of tools: provision of total credit leave, cancellation of various types of payments, new, extended repayment schedules have been developed. At this stage, the interest rates on loans have been provided as low as possible, taking into account that in the current situation it is necessary to fight hand in hand, manage the risks together, and if there are some difficulties, distribute them among us and our partners to overcome the problems together. \nYou can get acquainted with the terms of the loans provided by the first state support program here.\nYou can get acquainted with the terms of the state subsidy program for interest rates on loans provided to the agro-processing sector for the processing (purchase) of agricultural raw materials here.\nYou can apply for state support agricultural loan subsidy programs at the following link.\nThe Bank is controlled by the Central Bank of Armenia.",

        "content_en": "With the support of the “Stepan Gishyan” Charitable Foundation, in the frontier Movses village of Tavush marz the pupils from now on will be able to make robots and create a three-dimensional modeling.\nIn the frontier Movses village two years ago in “Armat” Laboratory created by the Union of Advanced Technology Enterprises (UATE) the secondary school pupils learned how to program by using the Armenian “Aghves” (Fox) and “Kria” (Tortoise) softwares. They failed to make robots since they lacked appropriate devices. Today, the knowledge and skills gained in the laboratory will be used for managing robots.\n“Movses is a frontier village, and this program is also significant for the fact that the school learners, by receiving education, will be offered an opportunity to earn money just on the spot and it will also help prevent emigration. With the support of UATE the program was offered to us by the children together with their PT teacher. When you see such enthusiasm in children, you merely cannot but support them,” in her speech pointed out Anna Gishyan, the Director of the “Stepan Gishyan” Charitable Foundation.\n“The children will create the three-dimensional modeling by using “Bzez” 3D printer manufactured in Goris. They will basically work by using the equipments manufactured in Armenia. Thereby, we wish to show the children that there are numerous examples of success in Armenia and that the children like you have received knowledge and are able to produce such  equipments. In other words, you can also do it,” in his speech pointed out Sedrak Vardanyan, the Program Coordinator of UATE Engineering Laboratories.\nThe “Stepan Gishyan” Charitable Foundation was founded in 2015 by ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE BANK, French Credit Agricole, Credit Agricole National Federation and the Gishyan Family.\nTo see the video, follow this link.",

        "content_en": "ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE BANK, being one of the first partners of the Russian payment system MIR in Armenia, announces the launch of the new ArCa-MIR chip card. The card will operate as an ArCa card in the territory of the Republic of Armenia and as a MIR card in the Russian Federation.The new \"ArCa-MIR\" card will allow to make transactions in the territory of the Russian Federation with more affordable terms, as well as use it in the 24/7 for \"urgent\" money transfer. Specifically: from now on, at any time of the day you can enter money on the card from Russia via cash-in ATMs, that provide MIR payment system cards and receive it in Armenia within minutes or vice versa.Round-the-clock transfers are made possible by ordering ArCA-MIR principal card with linked cards, in which case the card account number is the same. The person who transfers the money can enter the money to his/her card in Russia and the recipient can cash it out in Armenia using his/her linked card.It is noteworthy that \"ArCa-MIR\" cards will be provided to customers without service fee for the first year, which will give a good opportunity to try out the advantages of the card with no additional expenses.One of the peculiarities of the new card is the exchange rate applied to the payment card for card transactions within the MIR payment system service network and ATMs, if the transaction was done in the currency different from the card currency. Unlike other payment systems, in this case, the exchange rate is the rate of the transaction date, which helps the customers to be protected against abrupt changes in fluctuations of foreign exchange rates.MIR cards are already served by ATMs of ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE Bank, and regarding the service of cards via POS terminals installed in trade and service centers cooperating with the Bank, the latter is already in the process of re-signing the existing contracts and activating MIR card service.",

        "content_en": "Banks.am had a conversation with ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE BANK Deputy of SME, Corporate and Agricultural Business Norik Nazaryan.\n - Mr. Nazaryan, what is the current situation in the sphere of corporate lending, how is the competition in the market?- After the financial turmoil in the Armenian economy in 2013, there was passivity, mainly due to the crisis in Russia and the inflation of the ruble, which caused serious problems for our exporters, also influencing domestic companies. The total purchasing capacity of the population had fallen. Today the situation has improved. The exporters are signing prospective agreements, there is activeness among the processing companies in the sphere of agriculture. They are starting to work hard on expanding the geography of export, at the same time hitting the European and American markets. Moreover, last year RA Central bank defined a new, higher limit of total equity, which created interesting developments in the banking sector.   \nAs a result of equity increase and bank incorporations a noticeable amount of free resources, which are to be distributed, particularly through increase of lending. We can register that there is a significant activeness in the market from January 2017.     - Recently you have launched a campaign of freeing the SMEs from interest rates. What are the results, and do you intend on making it continuous?- I would like to emphasize that during the recent years with every our step we do everything  to support the SMEs in Armenia and foster their development in Armenia. This initiative is another step to support our partners. This time we offered our customers to “freshen up their business” by giving them an opportunity not to repay interest amounts for the  first 100 days and serve that amounts to their business development. \nThe campaign launched on May 10 and will last until August 1 (including). It also regards the loans in the amount of up to 100 MM AMD, with the duration of 3-6 months, which are disbursed by the bank from 12% annual interest rate in case of AMD, and 10% in case of USD and Euro. Moreover, we attached a number of products to the offer and freed the SMEs of their fees by offering packages. The package includes Green Leasing offered by “AGBA Leasing” with a 2% smaller interest rate. There is a month left to the campaign, but the results are already satisfying.  Generally, we support and will continue supporting the SMEs, but the ways of support will differ from time to time.   - What other projects and products do you offer? Is ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE BANK highly interested in SME lending?  - We offer the SMEs a wide range of banking tools from traditional loans to leasing (provided by the member of financial group “AGBA Leasing”).  SME lending has always been and will remain in the center of ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE BANK’s attention. It takes around 30-33% of the bank’s loan portfolio: this share has remained the same during recent years, that means that it increases along with the increase of total portfolio. The number of our SME customers continuously increases due to the expansion of branch network and new innovative products launches.   - How much are the trainings organized for the SMEs demanded, can they be considered successful?   - Along with providing banking services, during the recent 3 years we initiated the organization of trainings for SME representatives, by which we share the best experience regarding financial, managerial and hotel business. The project is successful and from the beginning more than 600 representatives have taken part in the trainings. And this year we received an invitation and presented our experience to other organizations in the frameworks of the international business forum. I would like to mention that only in May we have organized 2 events for SME representatives. Both of them were unprecedented: one was dedicated to leadership hosted by one of the leading professionals in the field-Martin Galstyan, and the other one was held in cooperation with the representation of  “Microsoft” corporation in Armenia, in the frameworks of which successful examples of business digitization in Armenia and its perspectives. During the same event the a cooperation memorandum was signed, and we will inform about the news in the fall.",

In addition, 20% of the necessary hail-protecting networks will be provided to the farmers by UNDP as a grant investment.  \n             During the project ARNAP foundation will provide the farmers with consultation regarding preservation, usage and care of the hail-protecting networks, and the process of making measurements, providing constructions for network reinforcement and installing the networks will be carried out.\n          “One of the most important goals of the project is to create and develop the farms in Armenia, protect the culture of modern systems from natural disasters. The bank has been by the farmers’ side from the very beginning, and is one of their main supporters.

He is proud to say that he is somehow connected, even bound to his land and cannot imagine his life elsewhere. \n… He is a native from Bayazed. His ancestors have emigrated from Eastern Armenia from that Western Armenian city in the 19th century. And from then the generation of Gevorgyans has settled in Armenia. Today Vache Gevorgyan is one of the most successful farmers in Hatis, and he has reached all of this thanks to his and his sons’ hard work. \n-Everything started in December, 1999, when I obtained a 300 USD loan from ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE bank  for the first time. I spent it on agricultural purposes-bought a cow, some forage and… Currently I have 50 cows, not speaking about sheep, hens, and turkeys. The problem of food selling is solved,- says Vache Gevorgyan.  \nVache says with regret that there are less and less young people in Hatis village. Some have left in search of a “better life”.  \nMany people want the example of Vache Gevorgyan, his success in his homeland in the sphere of agriculture to prevent the young people in the villages from leaving their homes.  \n -Does only your family members work in your farm, or do you have other helpers? – I ask Vache. \n -Besides our family members we have employed a milk woman and a shepherd. The main force is our family. My wife, for example, who takes care of our livestock, is up from 4:30 in the morning.  That is the time they start milking cows, and my working day starts half an hour later and is over at ten in the evening. \n-Do you only do livestock breeding?\n- No, we have nearly 20 ha land, where we grow grain. We also have hays, where we gather our winter forage. \nDuring our conversation Vache’s sons were in the field and were busy mowing the grass, gathering it and transporting.  Vache mentioned that at this time of the year his sons work from sunrise to sunset. \nI was interested whether everything has been easy in his life, whether he had ever had difficulties. \n- Of course not everything was so smooth back then, as it may seem from the first sight. But the men of the land must love the land, put his heart and soul into the work, and also be ready to fight agains the natural disasters. And not only. There have been difficulties, but we have always tried to overcome them due to our hard work and dedication. \n I love our land, the men of lend should be kind, patient, not afraid of work, flexible. My only wish is for my sons to stay in Hatis and double our opportunities and people of our homeland and put their strength and effort into strengthening our country.  \n \nLevon Azroyan",

The years were tough… The challenges strengthened the young men, and they understood that they should take the responsibility for their future.  \nThe brothers didn’t despise work.   \n-Life is like this. If there is a food issue, every work is honorable- they say.\nThe young men became so skilled that they managed to collect 500-600 violet bouquets a day and sell them for 100 AM drams each.  \nWith the money collected through so much hard work they decided to make their business more “serious”. They took someone’s advice to purchase gladiolus seeds. The job was unfamiliar, moreover, it was risky. The seeds were sold successfully. It was in 2009. The first experience brought success and confidence to the beginner businessmen.  \nOne day one of the brothers’ acquaintances applied to them and offered to cooperate. Moreover, he invested 250,000 AMD in the business. Thus, their cooperation began, and, certainly, the volumes of the business increased as well. They had a lot of customers purchasing gladioluses. The flowers were sold also in Vanadzor.  \nThree years ago the brothers created their first greenhouse with their co-villager. But this cooperation didn’t last long. The brothers sold their share and invested the earned 2.2 MM AMD in a new business project. This time they started growing roses. The greenhouses, their heating and irrigation systems were created with the credit funds provided by ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE BANK with special conditions. The business, naturally, came to a whole new level, the income increased. The young men, who already have families, built houses, of course next to each other.\nIn the greenhouse the brothers have clearly shared the work. One of them cultivates, trims and injects the flowers. The other is responsible for the remaining job.\nI was also happy to see the optimism and generosity of the brothers.\nAnswering our question about having any problems, Aram and Armen answered:\n-We don’t have any. These rose greenhouses give us a chance not to need anything.    \nThe brothers intend to build another greenhouse. That will require nearly 1.8 MM AMD investments.\n-Do you have the funds you need?- I asked the brothers.\n-Currently we don’t, but we have a partner like “ACBA” bank, - the brothers said without hesitation.\nAt the end I asked the brothers:\n-Guys, during the years of collecting the violets, did you think that someday you would have a greenhouse?\n-What can we say? We dreamed about that, even if we didn’t have a rusty piece of iron in our pockets. But… dreaming is a good thing…\n \n \n \nLevon Azroyan",

        "content_en": "ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE BANK revises its credit policy. The Bank’s Chief executive officer Hakob Andreasyan mentioned this during the meeting with the businessman that took place in the Bank’s Lori branch. The governor of Lori region Artur Nalbandyan, as well as regional and community representatives were also present at the discussion.  “We have avoided providing large loans; we have cleared and restored our portfolio. This is a unique thing in the banking system, and we took that step as we are lead with the principles of responsible business. On the other hand, the amendment projects presented during the meetings with the government representatives and international institutions in the recent months are really impressive. Taking into consideration these circumstances, the bank board has discussed and decided that from now on we are ready to provide comparatively larger loans to interesting and promising projects. We have been receiving positive signs from the business spheres for months already, and soon we expect to witness noticeable changes in the investment field. This is our step aiming at taking part in the process of amendments”,- said the Chief executive officer of ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE BANK.     Thus, ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE BANK offers cooperation to all the sides interested in the implementation of prospective projects. The interest rates and periods of the loans will firstly depend on the financial evaluation of the projects and from the multi-influence effect. As a tool to decrease the interest rates the perspective of package offers will also be considered by presenting a broader list of the products offered by the bank.",

        "content_en": "This man has not done miracles, hasn’t found treasure in his backyard. No. He has just worked, not despised any job. He has worked in Russia for years naively believing that he can accumulate money abroad.  \nIn 1993 Kamo Khachatryan became convinced that one can only earn little money by working abroad and make the ends meet supporting his family. He came back needing financial support, applied to ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE BANK and obtained a loan.  \nIt is fair to mention that before that he had managed to buy a number of pigs. But as life showed, Kamo wasn’t able to “cooperate” with pigs and refused the idea of providing the people with pork on Christmas and started to work with large stock. He used the funds received from the bank just for that.  Kamo doesn’t even remember the amount of livestock he purchased, he just remembers that they were local breed, and were easier to adjust to the village conditions. \nIn the future, when Kamo received the reputation of a skilled herdsman, he started to add the number of the livestock.  He knew that sheep are also profitable. Today Kamo Khachatryan’s farm is quite a stable one, has 90 large livestock, 45 of which are dairy cows, 18 are bulls, the remaining ones are calves or heifers. He also keeps 30 mother pigs, 50 sheep with their lambs.\nKamo Khachatryan has also created workplaces. Except his wife and two sons, nearly a dozen people-milkmaids and shepherds work in his farm.    \nKamo uses only 18 ha of his 50 ha land as tillage, where he grows grain. The remaining parts are meadow lands, from where he collects the winter food for the large stock. \n \nToday Kamo Khachatryan intends to increase the amount of the livestock. That’s the reason he is going to apply to ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE bank, as he is the bank’s long-term customer.  After hearing this story one shouldn’t think there were no difficulties in Kamo Khachatryan’s life. Only two years ago he was forced to eliminate 170 infected pigs. And that, I assure you, would make anyone lose hope. Anyone, but Kamo Khachatryan. He didn’t give up, he just started to work more enthusiastically and soon managed to eliminate the damage.  And again, his old long-term partner, his bank supported him.\n \n… There is man in Kamaris village, at the foot of Geghama mountains, Kamo Khachatryan, who knows how to work, create and live a positive life. . . \n \n \n \n                                                                Levon Azroyan",

How would you estimate the decision made by the regulating body two years ago?-Definitely I consider the increase of equity of the commercial banks, which become stronger and more competitive, positive. This will have beneficial effects on the general state of the Armenian economy, as banks will receive or already have received significant available funds, and, believe me, they will not, so to say, \"sit on the money\" but will try to direct it on lending to almost all sectors of the economy and the social life of the population. And this in turn will lead to lower interest rates, as deepening competition for the customer is expected.",

        "title_en": "Karen Karapetyan received the help from his brother and the encyclopedia",
        "content_en": "When collecting information about Karen Karapetyan I remembered the correspondence of late journalist Gohar Isakhanyan, prepared on the 26th of June, 2012, which said: “The only exemplary 7 ha olive garden in Armenia gives 10 tons of harvest. In the place of the dried vineyard 50-year-old Karen Karapetyan from Lehvaz has founded an olive garden with 3400 “Meliano” and “Askolona” olive trees brought from Spain…”\nToday, answering the question about the idea of growing olives, Karapetyan said, that the idea was his brother’s, who learned about the climate conditions of growing that tasty and nutritious vegetable from   an encyclopedia.\nAnd the brothers decide to take a risk. They plant several dozens of trees in 2002, just for practice. The seedlings grow, bloom, and become bigger in size. But… the freezing does its wicked job. Karen doesn’t give up.  He confesses that if it were someone else in his place, one would give up the idea, but not him. With the help of ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE ABNK he manages to purchase 7500 seedlings some time later. He immediately distributes 300 of them to friends and just strangers during a village administration meeting. Answering the question about giving seedlings to strangers Karen answered:    \n-To avoid robbery...\nCurrently nearly 4000 of them have become trees and bring harvest. Last year Karen Karapetyan received 5-6 tons of harvest. Before that, in 2013, when there was no freezing, Karen’s harvest amounted more than 10 tons.  This year he hopes to receive 30-40 tons of harvest, as the trees grow, thrive. There are trees that give 70 kilograms of harvest a year.  \nSaving the harvest from freezing, then collecting it is just a part of the work. It needs to be processed, delivered to the consumer. The farmer has taken care of this either. He has founded an olive processing production in his home village. The processing takes 15 days. Karen describes in detail the whole technology of olive processing.\nDespite the produced ecologically pure harvest Karapetyan had a problem of selling it. Four years ago the farmer was saying “Currently I have to sell the harvest in a cheap price-1200AMD to the resellers. It is still difficult to sell olives in Armenia with a normal price”.  And now the farmer from Meghri has his customers. He says with pride that there are Syrian-Armenians among his customers, who have years of experience in olive usage.  Some even confess that the olives processed in the small workshop in Lehvaz are tastier than the products from factories. After such kind words one feels proud and feels encouraged to develop the business.\n… Karen Karapetyan received his first loan from the Bank in 2002 to found his gardens. The bank had taken into consideration the unique features of the farmer’s investment and did the possible to make the repayment schedule easier for Karen. This circumstance has greatly helped the farmer to concentrate on the success of his work.\nAt the end, we would like to mention that the 21 and 25-year old sons of the brothers help them.\nWe also spoke about other problems. Karen Karapetyan, and not only him, are concerned about the irrigation issue. First, if they provide water, it is quite expensive, 1300 AMD an hour.  And that is not affordable for many people. Karapetyan brothers have installed an almost half a kilometer water pipeline up the mountain, moreover, it is underground.   I want to install a dripping system as well. As usual, I am currently just exploring the newest irrigation technologies.\nLevon Azroyan",

I didn’t know how to represent him as a fighter or as a farmer who has had success in the sphere of agriculture.  In any case both of the achievements of this person are worth mentioning.\nVahram has been injured twice. Until today there are two stumps in his chest. Of course, they are not harmless, they have severe effects on Vahram’s health and because of the he nearly died twice. \nThe injured freedom fighter greatly needed serious medical treatment, which was quite expensive. That’s why Vahram Hovhannisyan borrows a certain amount of funds from ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE BANK to leave for Germany. But the funds turn out not to be enough and he creates a farm with those funds. And here we are, a decade and a half he is one of the exemplary borrowers of the Bank.\nVahram knew how to work with land since 8th grade. His father was one of the village’s combine harvesters and he loved the equipment from a very early age. That love helped him succeed.\nThe farmer says: “The land needs to be cultivated; land loves when you take it into consideration. Only a lazy person can complain from life when one has hectares of land”.  \nVahram is an optimist. Even though the doctors told him he had 2-3 months, he has survived the bad times, it’s already the 5th year, he lives, not as a convicted, but as a person constantly searching ways out of difficulties and finding them.   \nThere are 20 cows (12-13 of them are dairy cows), 13 calves and 9 mother pigs in Vahram Hovhannisyan’s farm. Let’s say that Vahram believes in the effectiveness of pig production. Sometimes he counts the profit that the mother pigs bring with tens of piglets.\nAfter speaking about incomes from livestock farming Vahram tells that he grows wheat on 60 hectares of his land, which he collects with his own equipment. That is also some kind of an income. \r\nThe farmer is constantly searching something. Currently he is in the process of building a bigger barn.  Vahram Hovhannisyan has read in the internet that it is possible to make gas from manure. Read and got excited. He intends to apply that achievement in Khndzoresk. He is sure that he will be able to implement that project as he has a partner like ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE BANK.",

        "content_en": "Vayots Dzor region, which has the smallest population in Armenia, is situated in the north of the country surrounded by mountains. This is a unique geographic island with unprecedented nature and extraordinary climate. The region is historically the homeland of world wine-making, being also famous for its healing mineral waters and resorts. \nThere is a tradition here: child or an elderly, woman or man, regardless of social status, position or hobby, go up to the mountains during the herb collecting season with their families to collect thyme, mint, hypericum and other herbs. They bring what they have collected to their homes, dry them and make healing teas and infusions.\n“We just decided to make this tradition more public and make it a family business for us and for the local people putting soul and love into this job”,- said Grigor Mnatsakanyan, who is the director of “MEGA Ararat” company, which produces tea. The tea factory is situated near Vayk, at the foot of the mountain, and by the time we arrived there, the sweet scent of the tea made by Grigor’s mother, Mrs. Ruzanna, had spread around.  Sitting around the hand-made wooden table under the mulberry tree, my interlocutor started his story- “Our family inherited the interest in herbs from my grandmother Emma: she was a biologist, a true expert of herbs. She has taught me and my uncle Mkhitar Matevosyan, who founded our company, the usage and feature of every herb”. In 2005 “MEGA Ararat” company was founded by Mkhitar Matevosyan. “At first it was tough, the volumes were small, we had financial and marketing problems. A short time later we hired our first employee. Currently, we have 10 employees, and depending on the season, that number can exceed 20”,- tells Grigor.\nCurrently, the company harvests seven types of herbs- thyme, mint, chamomile, hypericum, linden, hawthorn and dog rose. During the mechanic processing of those herbs Grigor uses the equipment designed and constructed by him.\nThey work mainly with the local people, but they also have providers form other regions and Artsakh. The price of harvesting depends on the type and quality of the herb, but according to Grigor, one person can receive from 7-13 thousand AMD for the collected herbs in one day.\nThe majority of the products of “MEGA Ararat” company are exported to the Russian Federation. “As the local herb market is small, we mostly don’t engage in sales of our products in Armenia in order not to harm the local small entrepreneurs. Since the beginning we have worked on organizing the export of our products, and if the export to Russia was relatively easy, the same export to Europe was a really difficult problem connected with the process costs and organization of product sales. Last autumn the manager of ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE BANK “Vayk” branch Tigran Mirzoyan called me and told me that there was going to be a seminar regarding organic certification of products, and a project and offered to participate”,- notes Grigor.  \nCurrently the production of the company has been certified after taking part in the organic products exhibition in Germany with the co-financing of NABU and the Bank. Several months before with the invitation of ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE BANK a delegation of German businessman had arrived in Armenia. During the visit they also came to our factory, and now we are negotiating to export the products of “MEGA Ararat” to Germany.               “If previously we produced 15-20 tons of tea, after entering the European market, the volumes will be doubled by several times,- my interlocutor said with excitement and added,- we feel joy and satisfaction when we see the results of our activities: these are the results of the joint hard work of our family, people working with us, our partners, and however hard, we are more than sure that everything will be alright”.\r\nThis year, on the 7th of October the competition of “Organic product certification” program has launched. The entities interested in this project can download the application here until the 7th of November, fill it in and send to the email mentioned in the application.",

After reaching a final idea to do this, we started to examine the honey market in Armenia and the further perspectives of the production development. The process took us around one and a half years. At first it was a little difficult, the beekeepers were suspicious towards us, the sellers didn’t want to cooperate, the customers didn’t believe that our product was ecologically pure”- tells George Tabakian.\nHoney itself is quite expensive, and when Honey.am was making the first steps, the company had to sell the honey almost at cost. At that time the greatest problem was to gain trust of the customers, and find a stable position in the market. Now, three years after the beginning, the company has registered quite big achievements: it cooperates with large store chains by offering types of honey which have extraordinary taste and expand year after year. The product has become quite popular. Currently, the beekeepers cooperating with the company work on the territory of Arpi Lake, Berkaber, Qarvachar, Shamshadin, Urtsasar, Haytagh, and each type of the honey carries the name of the area where it was produced.\n“Of course, export was also a primary issue, as there is a high demand on ecologically pure products all over the world, and our honey meets all that requirements. In this case, our participation in the organic food certification program implemented by ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE Bank and NABU was very important, as we were announced winners and thanks to the financial investment of the organizers received an organic food certificate”, -told George Tabakian and added that in the frameworks of the program, together with the other winners, they have visited Berlin, Germany and taken part in Bio OST organic food exhibition, and most important, signed an export agreement with a store chain in Germany which sells exceptionally organic food.Our meeting with George finished by talking about the future and tasting delightful cream made of honey, which is yet in the process of development. Our interlocutor mentioned that the company is ready to step forward and expand the production and cooperation with the Bank and the German company, being sure that new and broader perspectives will rise to the European market.",

        "content_en": "The Bank and Visa today announced the launch of Visa payWave issuance and acquiring program in Armenia. The Bank will be offering a range of card products enabled with Visa payWave innovative contactless technology - Visa Student, Visa Classic and Visa Gold cards.\nVisa payWave contactless technology enables customers to pay by just tapping their card against a payment terminal without handing the card to the cashier, which offers even more convenient, secure, easier and faster payment experience to consumers. Besides, no PIN or signature will be required for payments under 10,000 Armenian Drams.\nACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE Bank installed first contactless POS terminals at Yerevan Mall, a shopping and entertainment center and as of today most of the merchants at Yerevan Mall already accept Visa payWave cards. The Bank aims at installing about 150 contactless terminals by end of the year. Merchants that accept contactless payments have the following symbol  on their POS terminals, all Visa payWave cards also have the same symbol.\nVisa payWave offers numerous advantages to customers and merchants including speed, convenience and security. Merchants can also benefit from serving customers faster, thus limiting queues and increasing the number of customers.\nTo showcase new contactless technology ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE Bank hosted a launch event at Yerevan Mall and announced a promo campaign for all Visa payWave cardholders: the Bank will offer 50% cashback on the first contactless transaction below 20,000 AMD performed on any Visa payWave card in the period from June 15 to August 31, both domestically or internationally. All existing Visa Student, Visa Classic and Visa Gold cardholders may upgrade to Visa payWave free of charge by June 30, 2015.\n“Having issued the first Visa chip card in Armenia back in 2009, today we are proud to introduce Visa payWave cards, which mark the next stage in the development of payment technologies,”said Hakob Andreasyan, CEO of ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE. “In today’s fast developing world innovations are about improving customer experience at first place. With Visa payWave launch we aim at reducing the time it takes consumers to pay with their cards, particularly for low value transactions. Today customers are more prepared to use card for medium and large payments, while for small ticket cash still prevails. Visa payWave is about changing this pattern and making cards preferred payment method.”\n“Visa is continually seeking new technological advances to enhance consumers’ payment experience and speed up migration to cashless payments. Our experience shows that Visa payWave could boost cashless payment in the market as this technology offers a new way to pay which is fast, easy and convenient, and consumers tend to pay with Visa payWave more often compared to the traditional magstripe or chip cards. We hope that Visa payWave will drive card payments into traditionally cash-based retail environments where speed and convenience are important, such as minimarkets, hypermarkets, petrol stations, fast service restaurants, shopping malls, and taxi”, said Irina Kamkhadze, Visa’s regional manager for the Caucasus.\nTo launch its first Visa issuing and acquiring program ACBA-CREDIT AGRICOLE BANK has partnered with two well-known French companies - Oberthur Technologies and Ingenico.

        "content_en": "On June 30, 2014 a trilateral cooperation agreement was signed between “ACBA CREDIT-AGRICOLE BANK” CJSC, “Hayastan” All Armenian Fund and World Vision Armenia international charity organization, within the framework of which a mutual initiative directed at creation of educational opportunities for the children of Gavar orphanage will be launched.\n \nThis is the first mutual charity project of World Vision Armenia, “Hayastan” All Armenian Fund and “ACBA CREDIT-AGRICOLE BANK” CJSC. The project budget is 41 000 000 AMD, and the project will last for 3 years.\n \nWithin the framework of the project more than 90 children of Gavar orphanage 9-18 years old will have the opportunity to receive comprehensive secondary and professional knowledge and acquire vital and most important skills. In particular, it is envisaged to organize classes with the specialization in the Armenian and foreign languages, mathematics, history and other subjects, as well as various professional trainings.\n \nThis project is the next project implemented under issue of charity card VISA BENEFACTOR by “ACBA CREDIT-AGRICOLE BANK” CJSC and “Hayastan” All Armenian Fund. The Bank has already issued more than 19 000 VISA BENEFACTOR cards and as a result of the phone survey performed among 1000 most active card holders of Visa BENEFACTOR, held in February 2014, among the offered projects the project on creation of educational center for children from orphanages was selected, which will be launched with the efforts of World Vision Armenia charity organization.\n \nWorld Vision Armenia Office Director Zhirayr Edilyan says: “At present more than 90 girls and boys from various towns and villages of Armenia live in Gavar orphanage. They attend secondary school, some of them participate in out-of-class study groups. However, the received secondary knowledge and skills are not enough for these children to be able to find a work and be fully integrated into society, when they reach the adult age and leave the orphanage. They need fundamental knowledge and orientation”.\n \n“ACBA CREDIT-AGRICOLE BANK” Chief Executive Director Hakob Andreasyan says: “Since the issue of Visa BENEFACTOR card, this is a new part of the project directed to the children of orphanages of Armenia, which has a significant importance for us. The Bank will continue its efforts to ensure scholarships for orphanage children, as well as find employment. We appreciate World Vision Armenia joining this project and we are glad that the children with low income families of Gavar will also have the opportunity to benefit from the project directed to children of Gavar orphanage”.\n \n“Armenia” Pan-Armenian Fund Director Ara Vardanyan says: “The idea to create an educational center appeared getting acquainted with 9-18 years old children living here, and learning their desires. Evaluating the experience of World Vision Armenia in similar projects, “ACBA CREDIT-AGRICOLE BANK” and “Armenia” Pan-Armenian Fund jointly applied to World Vision to take up the implementation of the project”.\n \nWithin the framework of the project of World Vision on territorial development of Gavar, other activities are also envisaged with the participation of children from Gavar orphanage and territorial communities, which will contribute to the formation of communication skills of orphanage children out of the institution, helping them to make new friends",
