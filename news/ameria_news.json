        "content": "Ameriabank has been named the Bank of the Year 2024 in Armenia by The Banker Magazine, a leading financial publication affiliated with the Financial Times (FT). Winners of the Bank of the Year Awards were announced at the 2024 Banker Awards ceremony held in London on December 4. The prestigious award covers 127 countries and recognizes excellence of financial institutions that have grown while retaining a solid balance sheet, improved the quality of their service, invested in technology and considered their role within their local communities.\nBeyond their operational and financial achievements, the award-winners have been acknowledged for addressing environmental and social concerns, both internally and in their interactions with clients, underscoring the importance of a meaningful sustainability strategy for the success of each lender in every country. \nIn its selection, The Banker’s panel of international judges suggests the year 2024 has been a pivotal for Ameriabank, as it joined The Bank of Georgia Group PLC, while still maintaining its market presence as a standalone entity and brand. As the publication stresses, the transaction offers significant strategic benefits for Ameriabank, including improved access to the international financial markets through BoGG — a UK registered financial firm listed on the London Stock Exchange. According to the source, being part of BoGG will allow Ameriabank to raise capital more easily, enabling it to invest in improving its products, services and technology. The arrangement is also expected to give a significant boost to the wider Armenian financial system and economy as well as opening new prospects for regional projects and business development.\nArtak Hanesyan, CEO at Ameriabank, has commented on this achievement with the publication: “Our focus remains on enhancing our customers’ digital experience, ensuring we stay responsive, agile and aligned with evolving market needs. Ameriabank will continue investing in digital products and services, expanding beyond financial offerings. We are actively building ecosystem solutions to serve our customers, wherever they are, and address their financial and non-financial needs across daily interactions and lifetime goals.”\nAmeriabank is honored with the Bank of the Year award for the ninth time since 2010.\nThis latest recognition marks the third major accolade for Ameriabank in 2024, following the Awards for Excellence as the Best Bank of Armenia by Euromoney and the Best Bank in Armenia for 2024 by Global Finance Magazine—the most prestigious awards in the global banking industry, all received within a single year. \n \nThe Bank is regulated by the Central Bank of Armenia.",

        "content": "Ameriabank has been recognized as Armenia’s best bank for real estate by an international financial publication Euromoney, becoming the first-ever recipient of this award in Armenia. The Real Estate Awards honor excellence in the commercial real estate sector, acknowledging not only financial success and client service, but also a commitment to improving the sector through technological advances and sustainability initiatives.\nAccording to Euromoney, Ameriabank achieved notable growth in its real estate business in Armenia during the review period from June 2023 to June 2024. The bank’s gross mortgage loan portfolio grew by 25.3% to AMD 233.2 billion (US$600 million), capturing a 21.3% share of the Armenian mortgage market as of June 2024.\nThe publication highlights that this success is closely tied to the growth of MyHome.am, the digital mortgage platform, which allows users to search for properties and secure mortgage loans entirely online. A first in Armenia’s banking sector, the platform facilitates everything from property search to contract signing. Over AMD 18 billion in loans were issued on the portal over the review period, amounting to 50% of Ameriabank’s mortgage loan portfolio in the primary market, up from 38.3% a year earlier.\nEuromoney stresses that the platform also expanded significantly, with the number of developers onboard rising from 25 at its launch to 68 by mid-2024, including a 172% increase in developers from regions. Property listings grew by 226%, featuring 3,100 apartments in 115 buildings by June 2024. Additionally, the platform’s new secondary market feature boosted apartment listings by 950 during the review period.\nAmeriabank’s Retail Banking Director, Arman Barseghyan, commented on the Awards results: “At Ameriabank, we are committed to develop innovative solutions that enhance the digital experience for our customers and partners. The success of the MyHome.am platform is a testament to our commitment to building a comprehensive ecosystem that streamlines the home-buying process and fosters the growth of Armenia’s real estate market. We are deeply honored by this recognition and sincerely thank the Awards Jury for acknowledging our efforts and achievements to date”․\nTo add, Ameriabank’s mortgage team recently presented the bank’s latest accomplishments at the Synchome 2024 workshop in Prague. The event brought together around 70 international delegates from banking, fintech, alternative mortgage, and other key industry sectors from more than 15 countries. Participants discussed technological advancements and innovative solutions in home loan ecosystems.\nAmeriabank is the absolute leader in the mortgage market of Armenia, with a 22% market share and a loan portfolio exceeding AMD 285 billion as of September 30, 2024.",

        "content": "The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Ameriabank have signed an agreement enabling Ameriabank to attract trade finance funding from the EBRD in Armenian Drams. This is the first and so far the only agreement of this kind signed by EBRD to date in Armenia. This collaboration aims to enhance Ameriabank's capacity to support local businesses engaged in international trade by ensuring access to stable and localized funding solutions.\nUnder this arrangement, the EBRD will facilitate trade finance transactions denominated in Armenian Drams, thereby mitigating foreign exchange risks and enhancing financial predictability for businesses involved in import and export activities financed by Ameriabank. By leveraging their combined expertise and resources, the EBRD and Ameriabank aim to foster economic growth and resilience within the region.\n“For over a decade, Ameriabank has pioneered new trade finance opportunities and solutions in the Armenian market, and the invaluable support of EBRD, their extensive range of tools and resources has greatly supported us in promoting and facilitating international trade. This time, again, we are proud to be the first in the Armenian market to amend the RCA Agreement, allowing us to secure local currency funding to bolster the business of local exporters and importers. This aligns with our strategy of continuous contribution to the economy of Armenia,” commented Artak Hanesyan, CEO at Ameriabank.\n\"We are very pleased to expand our cooperation with Ameriabank, one of longstanding partners in Armenia, where we recently reaffirmed our shareholding commitment. This new facility in Armenian Drams under the flagship EBRD Trade Facilitation Programme will further help local businesses navigate international trade without the inherent risk of currency fluctuations. We expect this to be of great benefit to local businesses and to encourage more trade activity in the region”, said Francis Malige, EBRD Managing Director, Financial Institutions.\nCooperation between Ameriabank and the EBRD under the Trade Facilitation Programme (TFP) began in 2010. Since then, trade finance deals have been signed to support high-growth economic sectors, including IT, construction, energy, and manufacturing, while also facilitating external trade.\nIn 2013, Ameriabank became the first Armenian bank to receive confirming bank status under the EBRD TFP, which enabled the bank to make trade finance tools such as letters of credit (LCs) and bank guarantees more accessible for local exporters. Ameriabank is also a multiple winner of the TFP Deal of the Year annual award, recognizing financial institutions' active and efficient trade finance operations and successful international partnerships.",

        "content": "YEREVAN — Children of Armenia Fund (COAF) and Ameriabank present their joint program “Harvesting Nature’s Bounty”, to be implemented as part of COAF’s Beekeeping to Empower Economic System (BEES) project. \nThe mission of the program is to promote beekeeping in Lori region of Armenia, improve the practical skills of beekeepers, and enhance the quality of the beekeeping value chain. Complete with educational, economic and social components, the program is designed to engage 50 beneficiaries. Along with attending innovative training courses, the beneficiaries will be provided with beehives and bee colonies to start their own business in future. One of the key goals of the project is to include among the beneficiaries also those COAF SMART Center students, who have been forcibly displaced from Artsakh, are currently enrolled in the  SMART Center’s agrotech program and have shown interest in and possess potential in beekeeping as a field.\n“Ameriabank highly values entrepreneurship as an important driver of economic empowerment of our country, especially regions outside the capital city. In this respect we especially highlight resource-efficient and environmentally sustainable spheres. In supporting beekeeping in rural communities, we set it as our aim, along with development of regional entrepreneurship, to improve the quality of life of people in these communities by empowering them with the opportunity to establish sustainable production and pursue effective long-term occupation”, - emphasizing the importance of supporting such projects, says Rebecca Hakobyan, Chief Marketing and Communication Officer at Ameriabank.\nReferring to the long-standing fruitful cooperation between COAF and Ameriabank, Haig Boyadjian, Vice President of Development at COAF, says: “Ameriabank is a trusted partner of COAF, supporting us in various initiatives. This cooperation is important as part of the beekeeping development project, as a significant booster of the potential of Lori region. It is common knowledge that beekeeping is a vital sector, by developing which we can contribute not only to preservation of local biodiversity, but also to increased employment and steady earnings in rural communities”.\nCOAF is no novice to beekeeping. Back in 2022, the fund successfully launched its Beekeeping to Empower Economic System (BEES) project, as part of which the Beekeeping Center was established under Lori’s SMART Center, complete with all the necessary equipment and facilities to enable beekeepers to produce and market quality products.",

MyTour was integrated into MyAmeria application in cooperation with Dinno company. \n \n“Taken the growing number of outbound travel destinations and offers in the market, finding the right package that meets your needs is now a time-consuming and effort-intensive process. The purpose of MyTour is to transform the trip planning process and offer an unprecedented opportunity to view and book comprehensive tour packages on the spot”, - says Lilit Hayrapetyan, MyTour Product Manager.\n \nThis tool is the first of its kind on the market. It allows users to view simultaneously dozens of tour packages on one platform, with enhanced features - the user can make instant calculations of package prices changing the number of travelers or days of the trip, the flight date, etc. Once the final choice is made, the user can book the tour on the same platform. \n \nThe slogan of MyTour is “from app to the beach”, which is completely in line with our goals, because by launching MyAmeria we sought to do more for our clients than just digitize traditional banking services, offer a range of financial and non-financial services on a single platform. In pursuit of this purpose, we are constantly improving the app and adding new features. And this is just the beginning”, - says Ruzanna Grigoryan, head of Ameriabank’s Digital Sales and Experience Division. \n \nAt the moment, MyTour platform offers tour packages to Egypt. Soon, the geography of packages will expand to cover new destinations.\n \n“Packages to Egypt are provided by Skytour, one of the leading tour operators. In the near future, we are also planning to expand the list of services in this regard, offering not only new destinations, but also the opportunity to view packages offered by different travel agencies on a single platform. From a long-term planning perspective, we consider MyTour as a travel ecosystem that will revolutionize the way people plan their trips and the way they travel, transforming every trip into a careless and memorable experience”, - says Lilit Hayrapetyan.\n \nFor now, the new service is available for iOS users only.

        "title": "How Ameriabank continued to deliver success amid the volatility of the global markets",
        "content": "Ameriabank CEO Artak Hanesyan’s interview with Global Finance magazine\n- Given the volatility that has characterised markets over the past few years, how has the bank worked to mitigate the risks and continue to thrive?   \n-  Ameriabank has enjoyed a steadily successful trajectory over the past few years.  In a challenging environment marked by geopolitical tension and market volatility, the Bank has demonstrated resilience and outperformed the market benchmarks across several key financial indicators. This is founded on strong fundamentals with an effectively diversified balance sheet, a sound corporate governance and a clear vision for the future. \nWe have been able to apply a balanced risk management mechanism and an enhanced liquidity management framework to improve financial efficiency and deliver solid risk-adjusted profitability. Total assets reached AMD 1.33 trillion as of September 2023 with 12% compound annual growth rate since 2019. Ameriabank is the largest lender in the market with AMD 902 bn  loan portfolio and 19.1% market share as of 3Q 2023. In line with our universal banking model we continued to diversify our loan book further, with strong double digit growth of Retail and SME loans portfolio over the recent years, contributing to a loan distribution where Retail and SME loans comprise 61.2% of the total loan book.\nThe quality of the Bank’s loan portfolio has also continuously improved starting from 2020. Non-performing loans stood at 2.16% (vs 2․97% Market) as of September 2023, continuing a downward trend, while maintaining a level below the long-term average and pre-pandemic level (2.87%). Total deposits and bonds, have registered a 14.2% growth year-to-date and a 27% year over year surge, primarily driven by time deposits. Both the Corporate and Retail segments expanded their account holder base and effectively augmented their deposit portfolios, despite the uncertain external environment. \nOur total equity increased by 10.1% in the first three quarters of 2023, reaching 190 billion drams, underpinned by a 17% CAGR since 2019 fuelled by robust profit generation. In fact our net profit has been growing in double digits for the recent years due to both net interest and non-interest income, proving the sustainability of the bank’s profit generation. As a result, the profitability indicators are at historically high levels (NIM stood at 6.4%, ROE at 26% and ROA at 3.6%), significantly outperforming the market average as well.\nThis dynamic performance has driven impressive investor interest and ensures that Ameriabank will continue on its transformational journey. In fact in this respect, the bank’s success reflects the positive macroeconomic environment: Armenia’s economy demonstrated resilience and high growth potential with 12.6% GDP growth in 2022 at the same time managing to maintain the lowest inflation rate and most stable currency in the region.  \n-  Are there any specific measures or instruments that have been put in place to protect the bank’s fundamentals?\n- Ameriabank has always taken care to see that its corporate governance aligns with the best international financial and institutional practices. This has proven essential to protect the bank’s fundamentals and its credibility. The absolute majority of the Board of Directors, who are responsible for the Bank’s overall management, are independent non-executive directors, with diverse international background and profound experience in the financial world. The Bank has also drawn strength from its diverse and dedicated shareholder base, having also international development finance institutions as shareholders (EBRD & ADB). Ameriabank has made its commitment to the highest ethical standards and rigorous compliance with international requirements the hallmark of its operations.\nFinancial soundness indicators have remained at a prudent level even during most challenging times and continuously improving profitability metrics demonstrate the bank’s financial health. In particular, the bank was fully comfortable in meeting the increased Basel 3 buffer requirements, having built the necessary cushions in advance. \n- ESG and corporate responsibility have become ever more important in recent years. What measures have you taken to ensure that the organisation meets its responsibilities in these areas? Again, are there specific challenges you have faced and, if so, how have you met them?\n  \n- We have always been a trend setter in our market in terms of best practice ESG standards implementation. Our commitment to sustainability and to the entire ESG agenda has been one of the cornerstones of our long-term successful growth. The imperative of sustainability, of investing in a future which safeguards our planet and protects future generations, demands that financial institutions play a key role. We at Ameria have been embedding responsible business practices and consistently prioritizing sustainability in investment decisions. Green investing, renewable energy and sustainability considerations offer opportunities as much as challenges, opportunities which Ameria is committed to take full advantage of. We were the first issuer of Green bonds in Armenia back in 2020 and remain focused on expanding our green assets portfolio further.\nGiven our status as a leading bank in Armenia, we have also shouldered our responsibilities to our own communities and taken care to support those most in need, including those recently displaced. We have made major investments in our communities’ futures.\n-  In light of these challenges and given the changing environment in terms of AI, digital currencies and the like, what work have you done to future-proof the institution and continue to deliver for clients?\n-  Imagination and creativity at all levels of the Bank have ensured our ability to adapt to changing circumstances.  We have been one of the region’s foremost institutions in promoting digital transformation, achieving a 69% online banking penetration rate and an 84% cash offloading rate, reflecting significant strides in its strategic development. \nWe see this digital transformation as opening up new horizons beyond banking: we can offer these empowering platforms to a wide range of sectors, markets and potential customers. From healthcare to travel to fintech education, where an integrated application of data and opportunity can open new vistas and clarify options, we are partnering with key players to leverage our technological expertise and take it to market.",

Within the framework of the two campaigns, Ameriabank raffled among its clients a total of 91 gift cards, each with an available balance of up to AMD 1,500,000.\n \nThe What’s Up campaign was designed for users of the bank’s MyAmeria application. To take part in the campaign, the bank clients were expected to make payments, transfers and loan repayments for the amount of AMD 5,000 and more with MyAmeria every month and collect promo codes. 57 cards were to be drawn, with a balance of up to AMD 1,500,000.  \n“Last year, we launched Ameriabank’s new mobile application – MyAmeria, and we have been continuously improving it by introducing new and unique tools, such as the Visa Subscription feature for the first time in Armenia, with which users can view the foreign platforms, where they added their Visa card as a payment method over the past 13 months and then unsubscribed. As a result, it is among the most downloaded Armenian applications. In the near future, there will be other news for Ameriabank clients – the Buy Now, Pay Later service, QR payments at merchants, cash withdrawal from settlement, savings and card accounts via the application, the option to add another bank’s card to MyAmeria application, repay another person’s loan and much more,” - says Anna Vardanyan, Head of the Digital Banking Service of Ameriabank.\n \nWithin the framework of the second campaign – Non-Cash is Cool – Ameriabank held a draw for all its Visa cardholders. For participation in the draw, it was required to make 10 non-cash transactions for the minimum amount of AMD 3,000 during the summer. The clients complying with this condition got the chance to take part in the draw and win one of 34 gift cards with available balance up to AMD 1 million. \n \nLet us add that more than 100,000 clients of the bank participated in the two draws together.",

        "title": "FMO, Ameriabank sign USD 50 million NASIRA portfolio guarantee to support Armenian businesses",
        "content": "The Dutch Entrepreneurial Development Bank (FMO) has signed a USD 50 million NASIRA portfolio guarantee with Ameriabank, a leading financial institution in Armenia. This partnership is aimed at providing vital support to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Armenia, with a particular focus on empowering young and female entrepreneurs.  \nThe official signing of the agreement took place in the frames of the Future of Finance 2023 conference in Amsterdam, marking a new milestone in the FMO and Ameriabank partnership. This largest NASIRA facility by FMO in Armenia also includes a technical assistance component, designed to enhance Ameriabank's internal risk management system and improve the services offered to the target groups.\n \nThe NASIRA risk-sharing program is dedicated to strengthening financial institutions, enabling them to expand their funding support for SMEs, especially those within underserved business segments such as women-owned enterprises and young entrepreneurs, in general. These groups often encounter difficulties in accessing traditional banking services due to perceived high risks. NASIRA plays a pivotal role in bridging the financing gap for these segments by sharing potential credit losses with partnering financial institutions, thus reducing the overall risk involved.\nHuib-Jan de Ruijter, Co-CIO at FMO said: “We are delighted to be able to support Ameriabank in its strategic goal to grow its MSME customer base. Despite the significant presence of MSMEs in the country, their contribution is only about 25% of the country's GDP and around 19% of employment, as the sector has limited access to credit. With the Nasira-facility FMO will be directly sharing the risk of the loan portfolio of MSMEs with Ameriabank, thereby contributing to access to finance for these underserved entrepreneurs. We are thankful to Ameriabank for its willingness to participate in this new and innovative risk sharing program that is backed by the European Commission and the Dutch state.” \n \n“We're delighted to announce our continued partnership with FMO and the launch of the NASIRA program at Ameriabank. This collaboration underscores our joint commitment to fostering sustainable growth in Armenia. This risk-sharing facility reflects our belief in innovative financing to uplift local businesses. We aim to provide financial support and essential tools for local businesses to thrive. The NASIRA program, along with technical assistance, will drive positive change, support underserved segments, and empower SMEs in Armenia. Together with FMO, we're paving the way for a brighter, more resilient future,\" Artak Hanesyan, CEO of Ameriabank, commented. \nLaunched in August 2020, NASIRA is a collaborative effort supported by the European Commission and the Dutch government. To date, it has facilitated 17 transactions with financial institutions across Central Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, amounting to a total of USD 371 million.  \nAmeriabank's long-standing partnership with FMO dates back to 2009 when FMO initially extended a loan to the Bank to facilitate investments in Armenian SMEs and renewable energy projects. Over the years, this collaboration has grown significantly, with a cumulative portfolio exceeding USD 200 million. This substantial investment has been channeled into supporting a diverse range of small and renewable energy projects, contributing significantly to Armenia's green economy.\nAbout FMO  \nFMO is the Dutch entrepreneurial development bank. As a leading impact investor, FMO supports sustainable private sector growth in developing countries and emerging markets by investing in ambitious projects and entrepreneurs. FMO believes that a strong private sector leads to economic and social development and has a 50+ year proven track-record in empowering entrepreneurs to make local economies more inclusive, productive, resilient and sustainable. FMO focuses on three sectors that have high development impact: Agribusiness, Food & Water, Energy, and Financial Institutions.

The rating agency also changed the outlook on the Ba3 long-term deposit ratings to stable from negative.\nThe upgrade of Ameriabank's BCA and Adjusted BCA to ba3 from b1 is driven by the bank's asset quality resilience through pandemic combined with dramatically improved capital adequacy and profitability over the last two years. The upgrade of the bank's long-term Counterparty Risk Ratings (CRRs) to Ba2 from Ba3, and the upgrade of the long-term Counterparty Risk Assessment (CR Assessment) to Ba2(cr) from Ba3(cr) follows the BCA upgrade.\nThe rating agency notes that Ameriabank continues to demonstrate robust performance as reflected in a very high return on tangible assets of 3.6% in 2022 and 3.5% (annualized) during the first quarter of 2023. This was supported by strong pre-provision income, lower credit costs and robust cost efficiency with a cost to income ratio of 45% in Q1 2023.\nAccording to Moody's, Ameriabank also materially improved its asset quality in 2021-2022 following the pandemic. The share of non-performing loans (NPL) decreased to 2.5% as of Q1 2023 from 4.2% at the end of 2020. NPL coverage by reserves remains robust at 80% as of Q1 2023.\nAmeriabank's capital buffer has materially strengthened over the recent years amid strong profitability and modest loan book growth. \nThe outlook on Ameriabank's long-term deposit ratings is stable, reflecting Moody’s view that the bank will maintain its sound fundamentals over the next 12-18 months. Ameriabank rating outlook update follows the sovereign rating outlook change from negative to stable. \nAmeriabank CJSC\nAmeriabank is a leading financial and technology company in Armenia, a major contributor to the Armenian economy, with assets exceeding AMD 1 trillion.

        "title": "New Forest on the Occasion of the 30th Anniversary of the Armenian Dram",
        "content": "On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Armenian dram, the Central Bank of Armenia, the Union of Banks of Armenia, and 18 commercial banks, in cooperation with My Forest Armenia, are establishing 50 ha of new forest in Jrashen and Urasar communities of Lori region, planting 160,000 trees (oak, maple, beech, linden, wild pear, wild apple, walnut, birch, and other tree species). The forest thus established will symbolize viability of the national currency as an enduring and future-oriented asset.\n20 hectares of the newly established forest will be in Jrashen 2, 30 more hectares - in Urasar. Upon expiry of the community land use term, the land and the forest ecosystem created on it will be returned to the community. Armenia is a sparsely forested country, and the present level of forest cover is not sufficient to maintain the natural eco balance of the country. This event is among the best examples of the financial and banking system’s appreciation of the unique role of creating lasting values, social responsibility, and nature preservation. \nOn April 29, under the leadership of Martin Galstyan, Governor of the Central Bank, Mher Ananyan, Chairman of the Board of the Union of Banks of Armenia, Seyran Sargsyan, Executive Director of the Union of Banks of Armenia, managers and employees of commercial banks, Aram Khachatryan, Governor of Lori region, and Andre Gumuchdjian, Founder and Executive Director of My Forest Armenia, and other guests personally took part in the forest establishment activities. With participation of all guests, a symbolic tree planting event took place in the afforestation area of Jrashen 2 of My Forest Armenia environmental organization located in Jrashen community. Endemic Armenian forest tree species were planted. \n  \nAfter tree planting, the guests visited Benjamin Gumuchdjian afforestation area in Gugark. After a short tour, Martin Galstyan, Governor of the Central Bank, Mher Ananyan, Chairman of the Board of the Union of Banks of Armenia, and Andre Gumuchdjian, Founder and Executive Director of My Forest Armenia, signed a memorandum of cooperation.\n“Today, we are launching the events dedicated to the 30th anniversary of the Armenian dram, to be held in 2023. It is very symbolic that the first event is tree planting. The Central Bank attaches great importance to supporting environmental initiatives in our country. Within the framework of social responsibility, we, together with commercial banks and My Forest Armenia, are happy to contribute to improvement of the environment. At the same time, we are committed to the “green” agenda and we incorporate it as much as possible into our daily activities and even our approaches to financial regulation,” - Martin Galstyan said.\n“Environmental programs are no less important for us. For years, especially during the past 50 years, people have been continuously damaging the nature. It is now time to understand that we are part of the nature and we preserve ourselves by preserving it. Therefore, supporting the 50-hectare forest establishment initiative is our modest effort to preserve the nature,” - said Mher Ananyan, Chairman of the Board of the Union of Banks of Armenia.\n“Among the events dedicated to the 30th anniversary of introduction of the dram, the establishment of a new forest and tree planting will perhaps be one of the most memorable initiatives implemented jointly by the Central Bank and all commercial banks. Our participation in this environmental initiative is a contribution to creating a lasting value and sustainable future. Every tree planted today is the demonstration of our care for the environment and a long-term social responsibility contribution towards the future. By financing the future, we are already trying to secure a green future for the present and future generations,” - said Seyran Sargsyan, Executive Director of the Union of Banks of Armenia. \n“This cooperation is of great importance to us, since more and more people are starting to realize the vital importance of forests for our country and people. After all, we all need oxygen and drinking water; forests do much more than simply cleaning the atmosphere and preserving the water supplies - they prevent desertification and soil erosion, serve as irreplaceable factors for biodiversity preservation, reduce air temperature, and help in the combat against climate change,” - Andre Gumuchdjian said. \n \n \n******** \nNovember 22 is the birthday of the Armenian dram. On that very day in 1993, the Central Bank of Armenia announced the start of circulation of the national currency instead of the Soviet ruble. The population of the republic has been using the Armenian currency – AMD, for 30 years by now. \nOn March 27, 1992, a special committee determined the name of the national currency of the RA – “dram” and its product unit – “luma”. By the majority of votes, “dram” and “luma” were chosen as the main and exchangeable currency.\n \n******** \nMy Forest Armenia environmental non-governmental organization was founded in 2019 with the aim to increase forest areas in Armenia. By empowering local communities, under the direction of scientists and expert foresters, the mission of the organization is to sustainably increase forest coverage and to preserve biodiversity by planting endemic tree species. During the 4 years of operation, more than 1,360,000 trees were planted in Lori region, on an area of 387 hectares, and reforestation activities were performed in Dilijan National Park. The number of permanent employees of the organization is 49, joined by another 200 employees from local communities during the afforestation and preservation season.",

Even though the year 2022 started with another wave of uncertainty for the global economy, we were able to maintain and strengthen our positions further, reaffirming the reputation of a stable, modern, and competitive financial institution with significant growth potential. \nOver the last six months, the major focus was given to digital transformation, compliance and risk management which we see as key drivers for future growth. \n \nReflecting on your bank’s financial performance over the past year, what have been some of the key highlights?\nIt is remarkable how much Ameriabank has accomplished in terms of financial performance and development of new products services and technology. In the past year we continuously invested in digitalization, improved our customer experience, internal efficiency, upgraded the services and streamlined our operations. The Bank’s cost to income ratio was maintained below 40%. We registered impressive profitability with strong capital and liquidity positions. Our annualized ROE comprised 28%, with net interest margin of 5.4% and solid non-interest income. In line with our strategy Retail and SME loans comprised more than 60% of total loans. Three year CAGR of retail portfolio was 30% and SMEs registered 17.2%. As always, the Bank applies robust risk management practice. NPL ratio continuously improved across all segments in 2022 standing at 2.9%. Cost of credit risk was around 0%, a consequence of conservative provisioning during the previous two years. At the same time, Ameriabank provided exceptional service quality with net promoter score over 75% and customer experience index at 9.5 (out of 10). \n             \n \nWhat are some of the growth areas in your banking business where you have been focusing, and will continue to focus, investment?\nStaying at the vanguard of the Armenian banking industry and its transformation, Ameriabank continues investments in IT technology and digitalization in line with its strategic priorities. A big focus will be also given to cross selling and up selling of services and propositions to growing number of our customers. At the same time a series of actions are designed for exploring new opportunities in certain sectors of economy, especially those that will also boost transactional banking and non-interest income. It is important to note that more than 90% of all transactions of the Bank are performed outside the Bank’s branches.  \n Finally, we will continue investments in human capital and increase productivity and motivation \n through intensive trainings. \n \nESG and sustainability is one of the most important strategic topics for the banking industry. What significant developments or initiatives has your bank led in the past year that demonstrate how important ESG and sustainability are to your institution? \nAs the leading financial institution in Armenia, Ameriabank acknowledges its responsibility to play a key role in advancing Armenia’s transition towards sustainable future. We recognize that climate change and similar environmental risks are immense challenge posing substantial environmental, economic and social risks to long-term growth and prosperity. We also support the achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and as part of this alignment contribute to financing renewable energy systems, energy efficiency, access to clean electricity, investment in clean transportation, technology development, and ultimately support to underdeveloped communities through various projects. Since 2010, Ameriabank has financed more than USD 250 million worth similar projects with the support of various international financial institutions.  \n \nAmeriabank is the first and leading Green bond issuer in Armenia. Since 2020, we have issued over \nUSD 60 million equivalent of green bonds. \n \nBanks are in fierce competition with one another to develop and launch innovative digital banking products and services. What are some of the new and significant digital banking products and services that your bank has launched in the past year, and what success have they achieved?\nWithin the fast-paced transformation of the consumer behaviour in the digital realm, we achieved promising results towards diversification and digitalization of our services. Commitment, agility, innovative mind-set and culture of shared success, driven by the desire to satisfy customers’ needs is the formula to success in digital transformation. \nIn this context, the past two years were remarkable in terms of developing and launching a comprehensive digital ecosystem - first in its kind in the market – that is a one-stop shop for banking and non-banking services, covering the car market, housing market, e-commerce as well as unique ecosystem for SMEs with options of online onboarding, machine learning based loan underwriting. \n \n \nThe global economic outlook is challenging. What are some of the main risks and economic challenges you see for your bank over the next 12 months?\nWhile Armenia is having a very solid year in terms of economic growth, there are still a lot of uncertainties and structural changes, including transformation of certain industries and shifts in global supply chains that should yet have their reflection on the country’s economy. While it is more challenging to manage the leading financial institution of the country under all those uncertainties, those challenges also offer a plenty of opportunities within themselves. Under the expected increasing pattern of interest rates, deterioration of certain risk parameters, increasing need for climate action and growing dependence on digital gadgets of our customer base, Ameriabank will continue its focus on data driven digital transformation, proper risk management and further enhancement of ESG practice to achieve our mission of “improving the quality of life” of our stakeholders. \n \n \nAbout Ameriabank \nAmeriabank is one the largest financial institutions and a major contributor to the Armenian economy, with assets exceeding AMD 1 trillion. Being a dynamically developing universal bank, Ameriabank provides a large package of innovative banking services through its omni-channel distribution platform and with clear focus on digital products.

        "title": "New digital services of Ameriabank: one-stop shop for IE online and free registration",
        "content": "To be a trusted financial technology space with seamless solutions to improve the quality of life. As part of its digital transformation process, Ameriabank has been implementing comprehensive projects recently. The last press conference held by Ameriabank focused on the new features and prospects offered by Ameria Business digital platform, one of such projects. \n   \nLaunched back in 2018, Ameria Business platform has been offering a number of services such as online account opening, online/mobile banking and online lending so far. Now the platform features a new service, i.e. a one-stop shop for online registration of individual entrepreneurs (IE). \n “Visiting Business.ameriabank.am page, customers may register an IE, open an account with Ameriabank, order a card and get online/mobile banking system for free without visiting the Bank.  All you need to register an IE is a passport and a social card or an ID card, an access to a scanner and a computer or smartphone with a camera. It will take you 20 minutes only to register an IE”, said Arpine Harutyunyan, a Project Manager at Ameriabank. \nKaren Karamyan, Head of Business Banking Direction at Ameriabank, commented that Ameria Business platform embraces such services as scoring- and ML-based online lending, SME Tablet, account opening, free online/mobile banking, business card ordering and some other services, which is a one-of-its-kind offer in Armenia. He highlighted that the automated loan approval has been facilitated greatly due to the ability to obtain data on the tax turnover of the borrowers. \n“This is a groundbreaking solution for Armenia, and global-wise there are very few banks that can offer automated loan approval based on the tax turnover. This is a first successful endeavor implemented jointly with the public system in the scope of Ameria Business digital platform”, summed up Karen Karamyan.\nDuring the press conference Artyom Shamtsyan, Innovation and Digital Officer at Ameriabank, spoke on the ecosystem design approaches.\n“We think about the IE life cycle today, the way they think, how and when they go for becoming an LLC, then how much time and what it will take for an LLC to become a mid-size business, then mid+ and finally a large business. How do the services develop along the way? We study what financial instruments and public services businesses need. Then we build our financial and non-financial services based on the insights received. Note that we cooperate with various partners in connection with the non-financial services. All these efforts make our platform an ecosystem since it integrates the services of multiple organizations”, detailed Artyom Shamtsyan.\nYet another novelty to be offered by Ameria Business platform is online registration for LLCs. \nAccording to Arman Barseghyan, Retail Banking Director at Ameriabank, only 4 percent of Ameriabank’s transactions is currently performed at the branch offices. “This means that we could take 96% of all the transactions off the branches, and they are mostly performed through self-service terminals or digital channels. This clearly indicates the pace of digitalization”, he added.\nThe new solutions rolled out on Ameria Business platform have had a positive impact on the retail business indicators of the bank. Namely, the number of customers has doubled over the past 3 years, up by around 55% YtD, the loan portfolio has doubled during the same period, up by around 28% YtD, while the number of online/mobile banking users has grown 3.5 times over the past 3 years, up by 51% during the 9 months of this year. Note that 73% of Ameriabank’s retail business loans is approved online.  \n \n \nAmeriabank CJSC \nAmeriabank is a leading institution of Armenia and a major contributor to the Armenian economy, with assets exceeding AMD 1 trillion. Being a dynamically developing universal bank, Ameriabank provides a large package of innovative banking services through its omni-channel distribution platform – an ecosystem, and with clear focus on digital products.\nThe Bank has adopted a customer-focused approach to ensure service quality and modern banking experience in an evolving digital environment.\nAmeriabank is committed to doing business responsibly and advancing Armenia’s transition towards a sustainable future.",

The other part of the loan funds will be directed to the implementation of green projects, in particular, projects contributing to the increase of energy efficiency and the reduction of carbon emissions in Armenia.\nAccording to Tarek Alnassar, Assistant Director General for Private Sector and Trade Finance Operations of the OPEC International Development Fund. \"We are pleased to continue our cooperation with Ameriabank through new financing tools for SMEs and energy efficient projects in Armenia, which will help provide SMEs with working capital and contribute to sustainable energy development and economic resilience.\"\nThe Fund and Ameriabank have been cooperating since 2015, contributing to the development of Armenia's economy in the directions of SME and trade financing. In particular, within the framework of the first signed contract (US$ 20 million), credit funds were directed to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in various sectors of the economy, including wholesale trade, manufacturing, food industry and hotels. The second loan (USD 25 million), which was provided as part of the fund's trade financing operations, contributed to the expansion of Ameriabank's international trade portfolio. More than 130 enterprises in Armenia received financing within the framework of the two credit agreements.\nArtak Hanesyan, the chairman-general director of Ameriabank Directorate, mentioned in his speech. \"I would like to express my gratitude to the OPEC International Development Fund for our long-term fruitful cooperation.

The Foundation works with developing countries and international partners to promote economic and social growth in middle and low-income countries. The OPEC Fund for International Development was established by OPEC member countries in 1976 with the express purpose of promoting development, strengthening communities and empowering people. Our work is people-centred, targeting programs that address basic needs such as food, energy, infrastructure, employment (especially among micro, small and medium enterprises), clean water and sanitation, health and education. To date, the OPEC Fund has allocated more than 22 billion USD for development projects in more than 125 countries, the total cost of which is 187 billion USD. Our vision is a world where sustainable development is a reality for all.\n\"Ameriabank\" CJSC is one of the dynamically developing banks in Armenia and ranks among the most stable and large financial institutions developing in the direction of digitization in the country.

        "content": "Global Markets. What are the main directions, strengths and competitive advantages of Ameriabank?\n- The basis of Ameriabank's success is not only realizing the need for changes, but also assuming a leadership role in the path of these changes and transformation. This is what helped us successfully overcome back in 2008. the global financial crisis. That's how we transformed from a leading corporate and investment bank to a leading universal bank in Armenia. And that's the reason why we consistently strive for digital transformation, thanks to the investments made in this direction, we were able to face the challenges we all faced last year. Ameriabank believes in the potential and future of Armenia's economy.\n \nSince 2008, we have played a huge role in strengthening the companies operating in Armenia and the economy of our country. Ameriabank is the largest financial institution in Armenia, which constantly strives to offer its customers and partners the best banking services and products, to come up with new and modern solutions. Our growth and development have always been based not on short-term interests, but on long-term vision, strategy and a number of key goals. I would also like to emphasize that our success has been facilitated by the trust of our customers, partners and shareholders in us and the long-term relationship we have with them. They have inspired us to develop dynamically and transform from a traditional bank to a fintech ecosystem based on human needs.\n \nGlobal Markets. What are the main achievements and successful projects recorded by the bank during the last 12 months? \n-    Although the world economy faced significant difficulties and challenges during the past year, we were able to operate efficiently and provide positive results. 2021 according to the results of the first quarter, Ameriabank maintained its leading position in the RA banking system according to the main banking indicators (assets, liabilities, loans, deposits, profit and equity capital). At the end of the first quarter, the bank's return on assets and equity were 1.5% and 14.2%, respectively. We also occupy a leading position in the RA corporate bond market, where the bank's share is 26%. In line with our strategy of transitioning to a universal bank model, the bank has increased the share of retail and SME loans. In addition, we have made significant progress in the field of remote and digital banking services, as a result of which the Internet banking usage rate in 2020 made 48% (an increase of 12 percentage points).\nGlobal Markets. This year, Ameriabank entered the \"green\" bond market for the first time. What plans does the bank have for the further development of the green financing sector in Armenia? \n- First of all, I should mention that the issuance of the first green bonds in Armenia was one of the important achievements of the bank. The total volume of the issue was 42 million Euros. The bonds were issued jointly with our long-time partner, the Netherlands Development Bank (FMO). Sustainalytics provided a second-party opinion on Ameriabank's green bond system, confirming its compliance with international principles and global market standards. Funds raised through green bonds provide an unprecedented opportunity to finance projects that promote environmental sustainability. As for our future actions in this direction, I should mention that we intend to become the leading green bank in Armenia and expect even deeper cooperation with our partners.\nGlobal Markets. Which digital technologies does Ameriabank consider the most promising? What are the main priorities of Ameriabank in 2021? for and future strategic goals. \n-    In order to succeed, any bank must adapt to rapidly changing conditions. Our priorities this year are further digital transformation and diversification. Accordingly, we are consistently expanding the capabilities of providing remote banking services, improving the quality of digital services, increasing the share of retail and SME loans, while aiming to ensure double-digit growth of the loan portfolio. It will help us to achieve our strategic goals, that is, increasing efficiency, further growth of key financial indicators, ensuring a high level of satisfaction of our clients, partners, teammates and shareholders, as well as maintaining an absolute leadership position in the financial market of Armenia.\nGlobal Markets. In a series of recent interviews, your international partners have indicated that Ameriabank is ready for an Initial Public Offering (IPO). What plans does Ameriabank have in that direction? \n-    In the last few years, we have become the largest bank in the country and have ensured the highest level of cooperation with international partners. In addition, we are continuously improving our corporate governance system. The IPO will be a very important strategic achievement for us and will contribute to the realization of our long-term development plans. Being a public company also means that we must follow best practices in corporate governance, accountability and transparency. I am proud to note that we are already operating as a public company, being one of the unique companies in Armenia whose corporate management system meets the prerequisites for an IPO. We constantly monitor international capital markets, listed companies with similar activities and set benchmarks for a successful IPO. I should also mention that the process of primary public placement of the bank's shares will start after the realization of our medium-term goals. Timing will also depend on market conditions. I would also like to note that all our steps aimed at our growth and development have one goal: to contribute to the improvement of the quality of life. The key to our success is a constantly transforming mindset and confidence in the potential of our company, our country and the economy in which we live and work.",

Promotion valid from April 26, 2021 to July 26, 2021 inclusive.\nThe main conditions of the campaign:\n1.    Only Visa cardholders who have not received a card-to-card Visa Direct transfer within one year prior to the start date of the campaign can receive cashback.\n2. During the campaign, cashback is available to each Visa cardholder only once.\n3. Cashback will be paid according to this schedule:\nIn 2021 from April 26 to May 26, including card-to-card Visa Direct transfers to cardholders within 10 /ten/ working days following May 26,\nIn 2021 from May 27 to June 26, inclusive, to cardholders who received a card-to-card Visa Direct transfer within 10/ten/ working days following July 26.\n4.    The cashback payment will be made to the card account to which the card-to-card Visa Direct transfer was received. In the event that the specified account will be closed at the time of cashback payment or the transfer will be received to a foreign currency card account, then the cashback will be transferred to the cardholder's other dram account in the Bank, and if there is no other dram account, cashback will not be provided.\nQuestion and Answer\nHow to receive money from abroad with a Visa Direct card to card transfer? \nVisa cardholders can make a transfer to your Ameriabank Visa card through their bank's Online/Mobile banking systems and/or website. To transfer money, you just need to fill in the payment card number, cardholder's name and confirm the transaction. Usually the transfer is made and the money is activated on the card within a few minutes. The transaction can be made on any day and at any time of the day.\nHow much is the transfer fee? \nThe transfer fee is set by the transferring bank. On average, it is 1% of the transferred amount.\nCan the card number be transferred to another person? \nIt's perfectly safe to transfer your Visa card number to transfer money to you via a Visa Direct card-to-card transfer. Under no circumstances should you provide other card details, such as PIN code and CVV2/CVC2 code, because if you have access to these data, it will be possible to withdraw money from your payment card.",

        "content": "Read customer reviews (Review)\nSearch for the store in question on Google and try to find customer reviews. If they are missing, then something is wrong. And if the store has certain comments, then you should definitely familiarize yourself with them, because they may be fake or written by representatives of the store.\nRemember that fake reviews do not provide details about the product and skillfully gloss over the shortcomings by presenting them as advantages.\nIf you received a special offer from a store to your e-mail address, before clicking on the link, make sure that you received the message from the official representative of the given brand.\nAlso, avoid winnings and advertising links posted on various social sites that lead to pages of dubious online stores with incredible discounts and low prices.\n \nWhen making a purchase, fill in only the necessary data\nEmail address or phone number. This is mainly necessary to confirm the purchase and send a notification about the delivery of the product.\nName/surname and address. This data will be needed when shipping the purchase.\nCard number, validity period and CVV code.\nIt is not advisable to attach the card to the site you are buying from, especially if it is new and not widely known.\nIf the store requires a copy of the passport, Mobile/Online banking password to be attached, then it is already suspicious and not worth buying from there.\nCheck the reliability of the site\nIt is advisable to use websites starting with https:/ and MasterCard SecureCode /3D Secure/ and Verified by Visa.\nIf the site starts with https:/, it ensures that the information you provide to the site is accessible only to you and the site's servers. By the way, websites starting with https:/ have a lock symbol next to the link.\nDon't give up online receipts\nWhen making a payment, all reliable websites take you to a payment page where you have to make the payment. If instead they offer you to transfer the money to any account, then avoid that site. The store should provide you with an electronic receipt that you can use as proof in case of problems. And if you made a transfer in the name of a specific person, then the problem becomes more complicated.\nTo avoid problems, it is desirable that the site has a feedback facility, for example, a Live Chat 24/7 service.\nCheck the security of the connection\nBefore making a purchase, check the security of the Internet connection, do not use Wi-Fi in shopping centers, cafes, parks. Wi-Fi in such places is often not secure, and any information you send over that connection could end up in the hands of hackers.\nWhat to do if you notice a suspicious charge on your card?\nIf you notice an attempt to charge money from suspicious addresses, block the card immediately by dialing the USSD code *116# from your phone number registered with the Bank and following the instructions, or block the card also using the ARCA application (the application is available on PlayMarket and App Store) :\nIt is also possible to block the card by calling Amerabank's 24/7 telephone number +37410 56 11 11.\nUse our tips when shopping on Black Friday, but then also follow the rules and shop safely",

        "title": "Card business loans from Ameriabank",
        "content": "Interview with Karen Karamyan, Head of Business-Banking Portfolio Management Department of \"Ameriabank\" CJSC\nTell us about the features of your new product, a line of credit with a business card?\nAmeriabank offers customers an overdraft with a business card using three products: online automatic (up to 10 million AMD) or semi-automatic approved scoring loans (up to 20 million AMD), overdraft up to 50 million AMD to a secured account, POS-terminals or credit with financing turnover, as well as customs card credit lines in the amount of up to 20 million AMD. The business card can be used by both the head of the organization and the employees, for whom separate cards are issued, each with its own limit.\nOne of the main advantages of this type of loan is the availability of funds at any time, especially if you have unforeseen expenses or short-term financial difficulties. This is a good solution, especially for small and micro businesses, for which free cash and collateral issues are always relevant. Today more than ever, it's important that the entire lending process is essentially online. Ameriabank has always had a wide range of online services, and in the days of the epidemic, this was, one might say, a real salvation for us, which allowed us to work normally without any difficulties. Another advantage of an overdraft compared to a traditional loan is that the overdraft does not have a mandatory intended use condition. the customer may use it for any business purpose at its discretion. An overdraft is a very convenient tool for filling cash shortages, making loan repayments, and paying salaries, which is gaining great importance in the current situation. In order to mitigate the adverse economic impact of the epidemic, Ameriabank has offered its customers the opportunity to use a credit holiday. I should mention that only 43.4% of customers used this opportunity, while some preferred to solve financial issues through an overdraft. An overdraft with a business card allows you to track all expenses and manage them effectively, as well as simplify the accounting process.\nOne of the biggest advantages of a business card overdraft, in my opinion, is that it allows you to save time, speed up business processes and earn more profit.\nCard credit products are not very popular in CIS and Transcaucasian countries. What do you think is the reason?\nTraditionally, an unsecured loan product is considered to be very risky, which is why it is not popular. Additionally, an overdraft or line of credit does not have a fixed repayment schedule, which is also considered risky. However, when we analyzed our loan portfolio, we realized that the quality of card products is not inferior to ordinary loans, and sometimes even exceeds them. In any case, there is always a turnover in the account, interest is paid automatically, and there is no problem. I think banks will soon become active in this area, because card loans are more profitable and less time-consuming, their interest rate is higher, operating costs are less. Therefore, the situation will change, it is already changing. The volume of business card overdrafts has doubled in three years.\nIt's no secret that many entrepreneurs, especially micro businesses, use credit products for individuals, including credit cards. What is the advantage of a line of credit with a business card for an entrepreneur?\nThe business card loan interest rate is 2-3% lower than the similar loan interest rate for individuals. In addition, the RA government is developing a bill, according to which, in some cases, businesses are obliged to make exclusively independent payments, and for non-cash payments, you need to have a business card registered in the name of the company. So the choice is obvious.\n \nHas isolation and the pandemic affected demand for credit card lines? If so, how?\nCashless circulation naturally increased during the pandemic. In the meantime, we did our best to minimize visits to the bank. Many companies began to require their partners to carry out transactions in a cashless way, which contributed to the growth of the demand for business cards. Customers who did not use overdraft before, or used it partially, started using all the features of this service during the epidemic. The demand for online services has increased significantly, and companies that previously developed the digital direction are now in an advantageous position. Ameriabank has constantly developed and continues to develop remote services, including Internet banking. Almost all of our services are available online. Ameriabank also joined the RA government's programs aimed at mitigating the negative economic consequences of the coronavirus, and all processes were carried out online. As a result, within the framework of the government's plans to neutralize the economic consequences of the coronavirus, 37% of the loans provided by RA banks fall to Ameriabank, because we were better prepared for the new reality.\nDo you plan to further develop this product, and if so, how?\nOf course we plan to. Our goal is to make business card lines of credit as affordable as possible for entrepreneurs. According to our studies, 95% of all loans with business cards are automatic and semi-automatic scoring loans, up to 20 million AMD. Therefore, we consistently work in two directions: improvement of scoring and business platform. We already have concrete solutions that we hope to announce soon.\nSource: SME Banking Club",

        "title": "Why are millennials moving back home?",
        "content": "How does Armenia attract millennials? Why do they decide to return to their homeland, change their lifestyle and connect their lives with the homeland forever?\nMillennial Hakob Tekrmejian, who returned to Armenia from the city of Aleppo in Syria in 2018, answers these and a number of other questions and shares his experience with us. Now Hakob works as a Premium Client Manager at Ameriabank, a partner of the \"Return to Armenia\" fund.\nHakob was born and raised in Aleppo, surrounded by national traditions and culture. He studied at an Armenian school and attended an Armenian Sunday school. Hakob remembers Sunday school with special warmth and a smile, and his love for it is the reason for him to continue his studies at the Armenian school. Here he gets to know the Armenian church and culture closely.\nAfter graduating from high school, Hakob decides to continue his studies in the field of economics. He successfully graduated from the University of Aleppo, and since he had a great desire to try his hand at a new field, he continued his studies in the field of law during the war, obtaining a master's degree in jurisprudence.\nHakob starts working in different companies. Economic, legal education and knowledge of 4 languages ​​create great professional opportunities for him.\nIn 2017, when all of Hakob's time was occupied by work and studies, he decided to come to Armenia for the first time with his mother and sister.\n\"Aleppo's Armenian community was very large. Of course, we communicated a lot in Armenian, but everything is different in Armenia. You are not a minority here, this is your country and everyone understands you. I visited all the places that every Diaspora Armenian knows and has heard about. And my heart and soul just stayed in Armenia. The first visit to the homeland causes indescribable feelings in the heart of every Armenian. \"I would like to return\", \"I will return\", \"I want to move to Armenia\". here are the thoughts that were bothering me. I knew one day I would be back here forever.\"\nReturning to Syria, Jacob's life continues in the same way: study, work, war, family. The idea of ​​moving to Armenia seems very close and logical, despite Hakob's fears of not knowing the Eastern Armenian language, being unfamiliar with the living and working conditions.\nAnd Hakob begins to explore the possibilities of living and working in Armenia.\n2018 in April, Hakob makes his choice and becomes a participant in the historical events taking place in Armenia, the \"Velvet Revolution\". \"In those days, I walked a lot on the streets of Yerevan and every time I passed by the head office of Ameriabank, I said to myself: how wonderful it would be to work here. I sent my CV to many companies hoping to find a job and stay in Armenia. Ameriabank was the first on that list.\"\nDuring his stay in Armenia, he does not receive a response from any company. Yerevan-Aleppo tickets were booked in 2018. for May 17, but an important phone call on May 16 changes his plans forever. He receives a call from Ameriabank and is invited to a job interview.\nThe interview takes place on the 6th floor of the Ameriabank headquarters, which is shaped like an airport. It seemed to be a sign to Jacob that he would fly to Syria tomorrow to try to get back at all costs. The first interview leaves a great impression on Hakob and his desire to work at Ameriabank doubles. The second interview is already being conducted from Aleppo, online and turning into a turning point for him. He leaves his life and work in Syria and returns to his homeland with great enthusiasm for a new life and new challenges.\nAt first, Hakob goes through an internship at the Bank to learn about the work of the banking sector, and after some time he is already employed.\nThe new work environment quickly becomes familiar and dear to Jacob, he makes friends with colleagues who are always ready to support him. Ameriabank gives Hakob the opportunity to acquire new professional skills and knowledge, and after working as a cashier for more than a year, Hakob is transferred to another department as a manager of Premium customers.\n\"My three secrets to success.\nFor me, I have clearly imagined that I will not just come to the homeland for a few years and return, but I will live here permanently, this has helped me build long-term plans and a bridge of dreams.\"\n\"Before I returned to my homeland forever, I studied in detail all the possibilities of moving here and risked implementing them.\"\n\"I am simply optimistic, I was ready to accept changes, face difficulties and be open to new challenges, and I believed that the doors of success will definitely open before me.\"\nBy the way, Ameriabank realized another one of Hakob's cherished dreams by gifting him a trip to Western Armenia.\nSource: repatarmenia.org",

        "content": "Marianna Vasilian, who left Yerevan to live in Moscow and then returned to Yerevan again, a mother of two boys, a wonderful woman, a hardworking and skilled professional, will tell us about how much she is connected to Armenia, what it means to be a good citizen and \"Kamar\" of Ameriabank, which is considered the leader of the Armenian banking system. worked in the branch as the head of the Customer Service Department.\nYou were born and raised in Yerevan. Can you tell us about that part of your life?\n- Yes, I was born and raised in Yerevan. I had a very happy and lively childhood with my two older brothers who always encouraged me to try new things and enjoy life in all its colors. I finished my schooling and entered the university here. I have had a very interesting life. To be honest, I think that my family's love and immense support shaped my life and memories of Yerevan. So, I can describe my life in Yerevan in a few words as \"warm, sunny and happy\".\nYour family in 2001 went to Moscow. Was it difficult for you to decide to leave?\n- Part of my family moved before I left. So Moscow was not an unfamiliar place for us. In addition, I knew Russian very well, thanks to which I adapted quickly and easily. However, living permanently in a hyperactive city like Moscow is a completely different feeling. I missed Yerevan and its tranquility, but there was no time to indulge in emotions.\nHow did your career in Moscow begin?\n- I started my career as an informant in a Russian investment company, and I could not even imagine where it could take me. A few months later, I was offered the position of assistant executive director at the same company. A few more months later, I met my husband there. So, at my first workplace, I started to gather experience, learn from leading specialists. it played a key role in building my future career path correctly, and I also met the love of my life. I had another wonderful opportunity to work in the banking industry in Moscow, first as a credit specialist, and shortly after as a leading specialist in regional credit policy and VIP clients.\n \nLet's talk about the return to the homeland. Was it the right time to make such a move?\n- I realized that sooner or later my husband and I would return to Armenia, because that has always been our ultimate goal. When our first child was born, my husband began to consider job offers that would allow us to return to Yerevan. And when our second son was born, we clearly knew that we were not going to raise them in Moscow. In 2009, when my husband got a great job offer, we made the final decision to return to Armenia. First, he came and created conditions for the family to return to Armenia. 2009 On March 8, I received a gift from my husband, opened it and saw 4 one-way tickets to Yerevan. This was the beginning.\nHow is your life in Armenia?\n- I successfully manage to combine my personal life and work, raise my sons, meet my friends and relatives, in short, live fully. Living in Yerevan, I can accomplish so much in one day that would have taken me a week in Moscow. Everything is close and convenient. You can trade in an hour break without any stress. 40 minutes and you are in nature. You spend your weekends with your children, have fun, meet your friends, relatives, etc. Your working days are filled with business meetings, inspiring work and striving to create the best every day. I think repatriates coming from megacities will fully understand what we are talking about. A day in Yerevan can be much more productive than a week in the metropolis. I assure you.\nAs an average citizen, how would you describe the positive and negative aspects of living in Armenia?\n- I will mention 3 positive and 3 negative aspects. The first positive is that you can raise your children without having to watch them all the time. My kids are free here, they can go wherever they want, and I DON'T WORRY about them. They have good friends, interesting hobbies and freedom to express themselves. We don't have to constantly work to preserve their identity, make them learn their culture, language. The second positive aspect, as I mentioned, is the convenience of everyday life. Our country is small, so all requirements can be met very quickly. The third positive aspect is the people who live here. We are surrounded by generous, intelligent, positive and caring people. People living in Yerevan are very sociable and always ready to make new friends.\nThe negatives would be hard to list, but I'll try. I would like to see our city cleaner. To see cleanliness everywhere, in the streets, mountains, parks and lakes, but it requires the efforts of all of us. Who is responsible for our country if not us? If I see trash while walking down the street, I pick it up and throw it in the trash can. Yes, it is on the street, not in my house, but each of us should treat our country as if it were our own home. The second thing I would like to mention is the scarcity of green spaces in Yerevan. We need parks, lots of parks. I would like there to be a lot of recreational and interesting entertainment places, playgrounds, interesting and interactive museums, etc.\n \nYou work at Ameriabank, which is the leader of the RA banking system. What does this job bring to an already experienced professional?\n- I was lucky. I work in an environment that is very close to my heart. The rules of business conduct here are unique and exemplary for me. I always admire them. An atmosphere of respect and mutual trust prevails in all circles of the company, and these are not just words. Everyone's opinion matters. This is the main and for me the most important component of business ethics. This is not just a big company where you come, work, fill out your CV and move on. This is a \"living giant\" that feels pain even if a needle touches its finger. This structure allows me to keep my leadership skills \"alert\" at all times so that no input from the team goes unnoticed.\nThe next attractive aspect of my job at Ameriabank, which I appreciate the most, is that our bank is built by people for people. Personalized service, modern approaches, respect for all customers, constantly evolving and improving digital systems, offers and skills. This \"giant\" gives us great energy to work, strive for the best and develop. I think the short answer to the question is this, although I could go on and on about this.\nThank you for giving us your time. I think our readers who want to return to Armenia will take into account everything you listed.\n- Thank you too. One piece of advice for people who want to return to their homeland. don't think too long. You can apply to the Return to Armenia Fund, create your new environment, apply for vacancies online and move to Armenia. I wish you all good luck.\nSource: https://repatarmenia.org/",

        "content": "Dear customers,\nAs you know, in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and to avoid the accumulation of people in the Bank's branches, Ameriabank made a decision to all its customers who are individuals and sole proprietors. from March 13 to May 31, inclusive, to provide an opportunity to use a \"credit holiday\". In particular, within the framework of the credit holiday, we gave customers the opportunity to make repayments for that period after the end of the credit holiday without additional interest charges, penalties or additional fees. The procedure and conditions for using the credit leave are presented in detail in the relevant public statement on \"credit leave\".\nIf you have used a credit holiday, you can pay the amount of unpaid payment obligation under your contract during the credit holiday, at your own choice, in one lump sum or in installments according to the conditions presented below.\nIt should be noted that if you do not fully pay off the unpaid payment obligations during the credit holiday by the upcoming repayment date of your respective obligation in June, then this will be considered as a preference for making the payments in installments.\nAnd so, if you have a loan with a repayment schedule, a credit card or an overdraft under which you have used a credit holiday and you prefer the installment payment option, the following conditions will apply to you:\nMethod and terms of payment of outstanding amount\nTo make repayments of the unpaid amount as convenient as possible, we offer you the opportunity to make repayments in equal installments over the next 7 months (June-December), starting from the repayment date specified in your original contract in June.\nAccording to our initial statement, in case of repayment of the unpaid amount within the specified period, additional amounts will not be calculated for them.\nFailure to make repayments in a lump sum or within the specified time periods will result in the amounts being considered overdue and the penalties, fines and other liability conditions stipulated in your contract will be applied.\nRepayment schedule\nWe will make available to you a separate repayment schedule for unpaid amounts during the credit holiday period and a separate credit code intended for repayment, ensuring that the detailed calculations and amounts of repayments for this period are understandable and simple for you.\nCredit code\nIn order to repay unpaid loan obligations during the credit holiday, it will be necessary to apply the credit code sent to you by the Bank specifically for the purpose of repayment of these amounts.\nOther loan repayments\nAll other payments defined by the credit agreement, which are not related to the credit holiday, must continue to be made in the current order/including the credit code specified in the credit agreement/, in the amount and under the conditions agreed upon by your agreement.\nReflecting the unpaid amount on the ACRA credit report\nIn the \"ACRA\" credit report reflecting your financial obligations, the amounts of the credit obligation paid during the credit holiday will be presented in a separate line, and you will have the opportunity to follow the repayment process of these amounts as well. These amounts are not considered independent obligations arising from a separate credit agreement, they are simply reflected separately.\nReflecting amounts in the loan statement, receiving separate statements for outstanding obligations\nIn the March, April and May statements sent to you within the framework of the credit agreement, repayment is reflected in the amount of the amounts that you have not repaid, using the credit holiday. The amount of the loan holiday obligation and other necessary information will be reflected in the separate statements sent at the intervals specified in the contract, which will also show the repayments of your further obligation.\nIf you use the credit financing service, the following conditions will apply to you:\nMethod and terms of payment of outstanding amount\nIf you do not pay the entire unpaid amount during the loan holiday, you can pay it off in parallel with your current repayments, in equal monthly payments throughout the rest of the contract, starting in June.\nRedemption after contract expiration\nIf your contract expired during the credit holiday period from March 13 to May 31, and you used the credit holiday, you can pay the outstanding amounts in equal installments over a period of 7 months from June. Details can be found in the table describing loans, credit cards or overdrafts with a repayment schedule.\nObtaining information on the amount of debt\nYou will be able to check the amount of your debt through payment terminals starting from June 1. A new credit code and separate schedule will not apply.\n \nIn the case of a one-time complete repayment of the credit holiday amounts, also within the framework of the credit or installment financing agreement, the March, April and May statements sent to you reflect repayment in the amount of the amounts you have not repaid, in the amount of the credit holiday, but this does not release you from the obligation to pay that amount, and you can carry it out. in the order described above, in the most convenient way for you.\nYou can get the repayment schedules, according to your preference, at the Bank's branches, by means of electronic communication, through the Internet banking system /if available/.\nDuring the credit holiday, you will be notified about the credit code created for the payment of unpaid amounts under credit agreements (except for installment financing), as well as the amounts to be repaid under credit and installment financing by a short message or e-mail with the contact information provided by you to the Bank.\nEmphasizing the health and safety of our customers and teammates, we urge you to use the Bank's remote support services and 24/7 Contact Center by calling +374 10 561111.\nThank you for using our services.",

        "title": "Those banks that are ready to work in the new conditions will be in the most favorable position",
        "content": "In the previous five years, Ameriabank's main financial indicators showed a progressive growth rate, which averaged 20% per year. A few months ago, you mentioned that the bank's SME portfolio has tripled in five years. Was 2019 as successful for the bank?\n2019 was a very successful year for Ameriabank. We have maintained leading positions and are the first among Armenian banks in terms of key financial indicators. Our successes were also appreciated by international organizations. 2019 Ameriabank won the Euromoney \"Excellence Award\" as the best bank in Armenia, was recognized as the Bank of Armenia 2019. \"The best bank of the year\" by the prestigious magazine The Banker, and Moody's rating agency raised Ameriabank's rating by two criteria.\nIn the field of retail business lending, we also recorded excellent results, recording a 51% increase in the SME lending portfolio at the end of the year. Naturally, we are not going to be satisfied with the results achieved. If you remember, in 2018 Ameriabank implemented a scoring system that works when issuing unsecured SME loans up to 10 million AMD. 2019 in the end we came up with a new proposal. now the scoring system is also used for the approval of larger business loans up to 20 million AMD, for which the credit specialist enters additional information into the system. This is a unique and very modern product not only in Armenia, but also in the region. The peculiarity of this product is that collateral security is required only for the amount exceeding 10 million AMD. This is a very important factor in ensuring access to credit for SMEs. We are in constant contact with small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, and we know very well how serious the issue of securing collateral is for them. That's why we tried to solve this problem. Another important feature of this product is that the system is automated and decisions are made very quickly. It gives entrepreneurs the opportunity to get a lot of money in a short period of time without large collateral. The numbers speak for the demand for this product. Within 3 months, the portfolio of SME scoring loans increased by 66%, and loans based on scoring made up about 60% of the total number of retail business loans.\n \nWhat is happening to small and medium businesses today? What measures are you prepared to take to support PMB under the current conditions?\nNow is a difficult time for SMEs. They must not only survive the crisis, but also learn to thrive in a world dominated by online services. I can say that we have always stood and will continue to stand by our clients, ready to provide the necessary support and overcome the consequences of the crisis together with them. Ameriabank was the first among the Armenian banks to announce a \"credit holiday\". We tried to organize the process using all our remote service channels to eliminate the need for customers to visit the bank.\nI would like to note that now we are also very actively cooperating with the RA government within the framework of measures to neutralize the economic consequences of the coronavirus. Under this program, we provide targeted loans to small and medium-sized businesses to cover salaries, tax payments and other expenses. In the current situation, the fact that the process is almost completely carried out online is no less important.\n \nHow is the SME online lending platform developing? How in demand is it? Has the demand for online services changed due to the spread of the coronavirus?\nThat platform was also in demand before, and now, of course, the demand has increased significantly. The platform enables the client to submit an application online by attaching all the necessary documents, receive an online response to the application and receive the money in the account if the loan is approved. In the case of larger loans, our specialists contact the client by phone, and the rest of the process - submission of documents, receiving an answer - is carried out online. The online lending platform is a very important working tool for us and we will continue to develop it. In general, the demand for online services has increased. People are trying to avoid going to the bank unless absolutely necessary, and we agree with them. We have revised the rates of online services, and we have set a free month for a number of services. It is good that the bank was ready to work in this format and to solve all problems online.\n \n2019 In May, you mentioned that you have been working with the Agile method with short sprints for about two years. Has this trend continued? What is your Agile philosophy and why do you think this way of working fits your business?\nWe continue to work with the Agile method, according to which employees from different departments focus on a single problem and deliver quality solutions during short sprints. Our innovation department coordinates the entire process in cooperation with business units. Thus, we get solutions in a short period of time that allow us to provide the best results. We developed a number of banking products in this format and will continue to work in the Agile format, given its high efficiency. We are one of the few Armenian banks that use this approach in their work.\n \nIn your opinion, will the competition among banks for the SME sector be preserved in the Armenian market?\nYes, I think that competition will be preserved, primarily due to the measures of the RA government aimed at supporting small and medium businesses. And here the banks that are ready to work in the new conditions will be in the most favorable position. For Ameriabank, moving a significant part of its operations to the online platform was not stressful, as it is not the first year that we have offered many online solutions and a full range of remote banking services to our customers. I would like to note that back in 2018, when we were just introducing the SME loan scoring system, there was no other bank in the market apart from us (perhaps there is none now) where the lending process was fully automated, allowing the client to submit an application online at any time of the day and receive loan within minutes. It is a great advantage for us, we use it, expand and develop it. We are currently working on developing a PMB ecosystem that will benefit many of our customers. We develop solutions and services that will allow you to fully solve all SME problems, from business establishment to lending.\n \nWhat key trends in global banking would you identify for SMEs? What directions do you think will develop most dynamically in 2020?\n2020 the whole world and all the banks are moving towards digitization very fast. This trend was noticeable in the past as well, but the epidemic stimulated the faster transition of all possible processes to the online platform. Our strategy envisages two important milestones: digitization and diversification, therefore, the basis of our activity is the automation of all key processes and the use of all available online channels. In this regard, we stand firmly on our feet and have all the necessary solutions. As I mentioned, in 2020-2021 we will work towards automating the PMB ecosystem as well as all internal processes.\n \nThe source: SME Banking Club",

        "content": "Perhaps it is for this reason that Artyom's ideas about repatriation are a little different. “I don't usually plan for the future. When I was mature enough to make my own decisions, I asked myself what was best for me at the time. For example, when the time came, I realized that Armenia is a very good choice for getting higher education.\"\nArtyom completed his bachelor's and master's degrees at the National Engineering University of Armenia, then moved to the United States to continue his studies in Rochester, New York. Thanks to his practical approach, one of the first outsourcing companies was opened in Armenia, where Artyom worked in 2005-2010. Then, with life and work, Artyom moved to Kazakhstan, where he cooperated with the state system, managed the electronic management center. After Kazakhstan, Artyom lived in Boston for several years, but wherever he was, he kept in touch with his roots. \"Every time I moved to a new city, the first thing I did was to look for an Armenian church, establish contact with the Armenian community, and during my stay in that city I almost always communicated with my compatriots. For example, in a city like Rochester, where the community is small, they look at you as a person who can tell about Armenia.\"\n \nArtyom heard about Ameriabank back in Boston. Although he had already decided to move to Armenia with his family, he was not looking for a job yet. Everything happened suddenly, but when he got a job at Ameriabank, things fell into place. Artyom realized that Ameriabank was the right organization for him, and that he himself could benefit the bank.\nNow Artyom is the Innovation and Digitization Director of Ameriabank. Before he came, there was no such department or position in the bank. Artyom built the department from scratch, bringing together functions scattered across different departments. With his arrival, a single centralized department of innovation and digitization was established at Ameriabank. This is an unprecedented step in Armenia to create a self-sufficient, autonomous financial and technological center from scratch. Moreover, this center is not limited to the internal processes of automation, but is actively looking for new products and services that revolutionize the market, which in itself is very interesting and motivating.\n\"In general, I am very satisfied with my work, and for the most part it is thanks to my colleagues. Everyone here believes that together we can change a lot. This is exactly what I would like to emphasize and draw the attention of our compatriots in the Diaspora, in general to all people, to this: how many opportunities there are in Armenia, in Ameriabank. My example is an opportunity to work on such a scale, but Armenia today needs people who will occupy such responsible positions.\"\n \nAccording to Artyom, the work should benefit not only him and the bank, but also the country, the state. \"Today, Ameriabank plays an important role in creating good for Armenia, and I want to make my contribution.\"\nOutside of work, Artyom is actively involved with his family and three children. According to him, Armenia is a very good country for raising children, and the opportunities that children have here are one of the great advantages of Armenia. \"Living in Armenia is good. So much new things are being created, there is so much opportunity to change something, far more than anywhere else.\"\nIf you want to achieve personal success and be useful to the country, there is no better place than Armenia. What you do here, you do for your country and people. In other countries, for example, in the USA, no matter how high you reach, there is no feeling of satisfaction, of creating value. Artyom advises all those who are thinking about moving to Armenia to visit Armenia in person, to get to know the country on the spot. In our age, it is possible to find any information, but seeing everything on the ground is different. Everyone always admires Armenia's delicious food and beautiful nature, but that's not all, there are things that are simply indescribable. Here are those unique, indescribable features - the environment, the hospitality - that attract people.\n\"Take the first step. Come to Armenia and you will be pleasantly surprised. Then you can decide on further steps, but your decision will be justified.\"\nThe source: www.repatarmenia.org",

        "content": "Artak Hanesyan, Ameriabank. one of the reasons I would like to mention is the economic growth of Armenia in the last two years. After the Velvet Revolution, political and economic reforms are being implemented in Armenia. A large-scale fight against corruption has begun. All this contributed to the increase of Armenia's ranking in the international market, as well as the increase of confidence in our country, the Armenian economy and the real estate market. Banks financing the private sector have played a significant role in terms of economic growth. The ratio of Armenia's assets to GDP was 83%. This indicator is close to the indicator of Eastern European countries. It shows the increasingly important role banks are playing in ensuring Armenia's economic growth.\nThe banking sector has seen impressive growth. Only credit investments increased by 16% in 2018. It is noteworthy that growth was recorded in both retail and business lending sectors. The mortgage lending sector has also become significantly more active, where supply currently exceeds demand.\nDuring this year, the growth of RA bank deposits was 12.7%. The activity of the market is increasing day by day, and even during the summer holidays, the number of transactions was not inferior to the most active periods of the previous year.\nWhat we are seeing now is the result of the banking sector and the economy working together: the increase in credit contributes to the growth of the economy, which in turn stimulates the increase in demand for loans and other banking products.\nIn the last 10 years, Armenia's economy has withstood two global financial crises and the Velvet Revolution without serious consequences and problems (bankruptcy, etc.). This testifies to the stability, transparency and trust of our financial system and banks.\n \n\"We have always built our strategy on the basis of long-term perspectives, we have strived for it\nfollowing global trends, even when the domestic market was within the traditional model.\nOur proposals have always stood out for their innovation,\" Ameriabank General Director Artak Hanesyan\nWhat helps Ameriabank to maintain the leading position of the RA banking system every year in the face of fierce competition?\nWe have always built our strategy on the basis of long-term prospects, tried to follow global trends, even when the domestic market was within the traditional model. Our offerings have always stood out for innovation.\nMoreover, all Ameriabank products are developed after a careful study of customer needs, so they best meet customer requirements. We offer a wide range of remote banking services, develop online lending, do everything to ensure high-quality service, security of transactions, save time and resources of our clients. Quality service, modern methods, professional staff - this is our guarantee of leadership.\nRecently, the international rating agency Moody's upgraded Ameriabank's rating to Ba3. What does this mean for the bank?\nThe rating review is due to the increase of the sovereign rating of the Republic of Armenia from B1 (with a \"positive\" outlook) to Ba3 with a \"stable\" outlook, as the organization's rating cannot be higher than the country's sovereign rating. Thus, Ameriabank has the highest possible rating for an Armenian company, which is equal to the sovereign rating of Armenia.\nThe rating of long-term deposits in national currency was raised from B1 to Ba3 due to the increase in Ameriabank's Baseline Credit Assessments, which in turn is due to the improvement of the macro indicators of the Armenian banking sector and Ameriabank's consistently high and stable financial indicators, in particular, the high quality of assets. , with a strong position in terms of capital, high profitability, sufficient level of liquidity and diversified sources of attracting funds. Moody's also raised a number of other ratings of Ameriabank, in particular, the rating of long-term deposits in foreign currency was raised from B2 to B1, the long-term counterparty risk rating from Ba3 to Ba2. These ratings are very important for attracting investment from capital markets and international funds.\nThe market is constantly changing, with changes happening in all areas, from technology to customer mindsets. And what changes have taken place in Ameriabank? What is the next step?\nTen years ago, no one could have imagined what path Ameriabank would take. The bank with assets of only 45 million USD and capital of 9 million USD became the leader of the banking system of Armenia. In those 10 years, the bank's assets increased 36 times, the loan portfolio - 130 times. By the way, according to these two indicators, Ameriabank has been the market leader for a long time. We are the 11th largest taxpayer in the list and are significantly ahead of all other banks. Since 2008, Ameriabank has attracted more than 1 billion US dollars from international financial institutions, which is the best proof of the trust of our partners. We are also a leader in investment banking with a 30% share of corporate bond issuance. From a small, inconspicuous bank, we have become the leading financial institution in Armenia both in terms of financial indicators, quality of services, and innovations. We weren't growing in line with the market, we were growing faster than the market.\n \nA major change in the past 10 years has been technological advancement. Instead of continuing our activities as a purely financial company, we decided to act as a technology company as well, actively investing in digital solutions and developing remote banking services. Our corporate management system meets the best international standards, and it is this and a properly developed personnel policy, thanks to which we have been able to create a strong team of professionals and like-minded people. The key to the success of our business is human capital and new technologies.\nAs for further changes, I am sure that modern technologies have been and will be the basis of success in the banking sector. For Armenia, with its small domestic market, technological progress and the transition of banks to the digital domain will be of particular importance. they will be the basis of the development of the banking system in the coming years.\nSource: GlobalMarkets",

        "content": "What contributes to the repatriation of young people? - Araz Kekejian\nWhat makes Armenia attractive for young people, motivates them to return to their homeland and completely change their lives? What connects them with Armenia? Where do they study, work, what contribution do they make to the life of the country?\nWe got the answers to these and other questions during the interview with Araz Kekejian. Araz was born in Beirut, has been living in Armenia since 2016, and currently works as a project manager at Ameriabank, a partner of the \"Repat Armenia\" fund.\nStudied at an Armenian school, actively participated in the life of the Armenian community. He studied informatics at the University of Lebanon while working in various organizations.\nAraz, can you tell us about your connection with the Armenian community in Beirut?\nI participated in the life of the community from an early age, I was especially active in scout groups. This played a big role in my self-development. Thanks to the community, I acquired one of the most important tools: I started to think and speak in Armenian, I got to know the history, culture, and culture of Armenia, being proud to be Armenian.\nFrom an early age, I was constantly listening and talking about Armenia, and it is because of this that despite the fact that my education was also in Arabic and French, I always thought in Armenian. I was always attracted to Armenia, although I had never been there. Being Armenian was a great honor for me and at the same time a great responsibility.\nYesterday I had the opportunity to communicate with a Russian repatriate. He had been to different countries and was fascinated by how Armenians living in the Middle East are proud of their origins, how responsibly they approach their history and traditions. According to him, Armenians living in Europe and America do not have that responsibility. Interesting, isn't it? Spiritual connection aside, what made you move to Armenia?\nI must say that I saw the same thing. In Lebanon, we consider ourselves Lebanese-Armenian, we always emphasize our origin. And for example, people in France consider themselves French, not even just French citizens, but French. No one asks where you're from. People around you also perceive you as French. it's a very different culture. As for me moving, it's kind of like fate. I thought that if I stayed abroad, the probability of meeting foreigners was higher, and it was also more likely that I would also start a family with a representative of a foreign nation, which meant that my whole future life could be arranged differently. I decided to apply to \"Depi Hayk\" organization, spent a whole year in Armenia and simply fell in love with our country. The day I arrived was the beginning of something completely new, different from anything that had come before it. I was full of energy, like a new person. All those feelings were still not enough for me to decide to permanently settle in Armenia, but on the other hand, I had finished my studies, quit my job and bought a one-way ticket to Armenia at the urging of \"Depi Hayk\". I originally planned to stay for about ten months, but during that time so many opportunities opened up that I started thinking about my future. What was supposed to be just an interesting trip turned out to be the foundation of my entire life.\n \nCan you tell us about working with Depi Hayk? How was the first month? How was the last month? What prompted you to settle in Armenia, what were the opportunities you mentioned? Is the decision to stay in Armenia a sudden decision, or did it take time to realize it?\nWhen I came to Armenia, my emotions choked me, I can't even explain what happened. I met new people, Diaspora Armenians, I was hosted by an Armenian family, with whom I spent a lot of time... It was a very exciting time. Exciting and fulfilling, one after the other new feelings, new impressions... I knew that I could have decided to stay in Armenia from the very beginning, although, of course, I had doubts. I didn't know what to do, it was a period when I lived between Lebanon and Armenia. My parents kept asking me what I decided, and I asked them to give me more time. When my volunteering period was coming to an end, I became interested in graduate programs. At that time, a new program was opened at the American University, which interested me very much: Data Science, and I decided that it was a sign. It was the right time to make a choice.\nHow did you end up at Ameriabank? What did Ameriabank give you? What are you doing now?\nI ran a course on data mining at Girls in Tech NGO. What is very good in Armenia is that you can find contact points with people very easily. I published my personal data for the course, after which they called me and said that they were very interested in my data. Then I was invited to an interview, which took place in a very pleasant and direct atmosphere. Now I am a project manager, as a team we are developing a new chatbot, a language development system that works in Armenian. Our core strategy is built around the Agile method and big data. Our work is similar to a startup: we work with machine learning specialists, Full-Stack programmers... By the way, I had no intention of working in a bank from the beginning, because my education is technical. But now I understand that I made the right choice, because Ameriabank is developing in a digital direction. When I got to know Artyom (Artyom Shamtsyan, Director of Innovation and Digitization of Ameriabank), I really liked him as a person, as a person. I was very impressed with his experience, as well as the experience and knowledge of my future teammates. Doesn't it matter who you work with? The working atmosphere here is very encouraging. from the first day I felt like a part of the team due to the warm and sincere attitude of my colleagues. Working at Ameriabank has many advantages of professional growth and acquisition of new skills, flexible work schedule, opportunity to continuously improve the quality of your work, willingness to help in any matter. Plus, it only takes me 10 minutes to get to work.\nI am happy at Ameriabank.\nBy the way, data science is considered the year 2019. one of the most modern and fashionable professions. Are there many female data science specialists in Armenia? In general, what is the job market like in this field?\nVery good question. The course I taught was an introductory data mining course. One student was familiar with machine learning, the rest were beginners. Our classes were mostly preparatory. We were looking at models rather than individual tools because tools are constantly changing. If you are familiar with the models, you can easily change tools. As for the question of how many data science specialists there are in Armenia, I don't know if I can call my students that, because it was just the beginning. I must say they had very impressive resumes, there were 3 aero engineers in the group and girls with quality education. Some wanted to change fields, others were already studying mathematics. I must say that all the girls were extremely demanding of themselves, they always looked for the culprit of failure in themselves. For the same reason, they could easily abandon the work they had started. I kept trying to explain that disappointment is normal, that you don't have to give up because of it, convinced them that they can do what they set out to do, encouraged them to keep trying. We still keep in touch. In any case, data science is a completely new field, and it takes years to acquire knowledge and experience.\n \nHow do you see the future of Armenia's IT industry? How can it contribute to the development of marzes?\nI am very happy that Armenia has become a developing IT center, but we still have a problem with professional personnel. This is very good for professionals living abroad and wanting to work in Armenia. I'm not saying that everyone should move to Armenia, but it would be good to have exchange programs. Right now we have a volunteer who came to us through the Depi Hike program, who works in the Innovation Center. He already has a lot of experience, his contribution to the team is hard to overestimate. Now that there is Internet, many things have become easier, people can work while physically being in other cities - Gyumri and elsewhere. I personally know an IT company with more than 20 employees working remotely from Gyumri. I think this is a mindset issue. If we all say in unison: \"We can do this\", training and finding specialists is a matter of several months. The revolution helped to change people's thinking, people began to aspire to greater things. If we all do our best, we can overcome any obstacle.\nSource: www.repatarmenia.org",

        "title": "MORTGAGE. What is happening in the mortgage lending market?",
        "content": "Interview with Gevorg Manukyan, Head of Mortgage and Auto Lending Department of \"Ameriabank\" CJSC\nMortgage lending conditions are improving, lending programs with preferential terms are increasing. Knowing about the special conditions, some are in a hurry to take a loan, while others prefer to wait. maybe it will be possible to take advantage of a lower interest rate and more favorable terms. How justified is the wait, what will happen next: will interest rates continue to fall or will real estate prices rise?\nThe demand for mortgages is definitely increasing, and this is due to several factors. There is activity in the real estate market. along with the increase in the number of transactions, the volume of mortgage lending also increases. The second factor is interest in real estate as an investment tool. Third, and perhaps no less important, is the government's income tax refund program aimed at paying off mortgage interest. The majority of housing transactions are carried out in the primary market, which is certainly facilitated by the ability to pay off interest at the expense of income tax.\nThe real estate market and the mortgage lending market are closely related and the growth of one contributes to the growth of the other. In the last year and a half, people who live and work abroad and are not even citizens of Armenia have become more interested in Armenian real estate. We also have such clients. In this case, we can say that this interest has increased due to the general favorable environment of the country.\nAccording to statistics, the number of transactions increases, which, according to the law of supply and demand, leads to an increase in prices. The increase in real estate prices in Armenia is a fact, but the market is not stable and both increases and decreases are expected. Demand is quite high at the moment, so prices are still rising.\nIn the near future, I predict a steady increase in demand, for which there are objective prerequisites. For quite a long time, mass construction was not carried out in Armenia. But we need new buildings that will meet the modern standards, the requirements of the new generation. People's needs have changed, young families strive to separate themselves, moreover, to provide each of the children with a separate room. The requirements for quality indicators of the apartment have changed. Perhaps all this leads to a sustained high demand.\nAs for the change in mortgage lending conditions, that process is continuous. Money is also a market commodity that can go up and down. As of today, mortgage interest rates are not increasing, and sometimes even decreasing. A number of government interest subsidy programs are in place, and competition between banks helps stabilize interest rates with little variation. I would not make long-term predictions about interest rates and real estate prices.\nOne of the ways to avoid overspending on interest is to refinance the loan, which can be used if the interest rate at another bank drops. Are such programs in demand?\nMortgage lending is mostly carried out with a floating interest rate. depending on the market situation, the interest rate may increase or decrease. Of course, this is a risk for the buyer, but the bank bears the same risk if the interest rate drops. Interest rates tend to decrease in recent years, which indicates serious competition in our market. In any case, if at any moment the client is dissatisfied with the interest rate, he can refinance the loan with more favorable terms through another bank. Moreover, in the case of rising real estate prices, it is already meaningless to talk about overspending.\n \nTo be honest, I was extremely surprised when I read the mortgage lending statistics. In just a year and a half, Ameriabank recorded a rapid growth of the mortgage portfolio and became the market leader. What is the secret of success? What kind of conditions does Ameriabank offer, how do they differ from competitors?\nExperience shows that customers need long-term, \"quick\" loans with favorable terms and controllable risks. Quality of service is also important to customers.\nSince today the real estate sector is developing at the expense of the primary market, cooperation with developers is very important for us. We decided that in order to meet the needs of both the buyer and the seller, it was necessary to ensure the effective cooperation of all parties. The main participants in the market are the developers, and with some of them we have reached an agreement to finance the acquisition of apartments in the buildings under construction by them under certain conditions. For the buyer, this became a risk management tool.\nI would like to digress here and explain why this is important. When we say that the real estate market is growing at the expense of the primary market, it means the following: the buyer is paying for an apartment that has not yet been built. The law provides for such an opportunity. According to the RA Civil Code, until the apartment is built, the buyer acquires the right to purchase. The law also stipulates that the developer transfers the proceeds from the sale of future apartments to a special account. The developer receives these funds only after the title of the apartment is transferred to the buyer, unless the buyer allows the developer to use a portion of the funds. In fact, it is this account that ensures the right of the buyer to get an apartment. This is a very important fact that many people do not take into account. Buyers are not always aware of the risks involved in purchasing an undeveloped home and how those risks can play out in force majeure situations. Yes, market trends are positive, but at the same time, we should not forget about possible risks. In addition, an additional incentive for the developer is that there is money in the account, which he will not be able to use until he finishes the construction. And what do we do? We take a lien on that specific developer account while working to preserve the buyer's right to it as much as possible. In this way we minimize the buyer's risks, which is one of our important advantages. We always insist that the contract clearly defines which part of the funds available in the special account can be used by the developer and which cannot. I urge everyone who wants to buy real estate, regardless of whether they use our services or not, to read their contract carefully.\nI should mention that Ameriabank's interest rates are not the lowest in the market, the loan terms are not the longest, but the product we offer is perhaps the most versatile in the market: quality service, simplified paperwork, the best price-quality and term-interest rate ratio, quick decision making on the loan. This is why people turn to us. on average, we provide mortgage loans of 3 billion AMD on a monthly basis.\nOur terms are very simple and clear: a certain interest rate, without additional service fees. We do not require insurance of the mortgaged property, accident insurance - all of that is carried out by the bank at its own expense. We have simplified many processes, standardized the requirements, created mechanisms that allow us to approve the loan in any branch with an accelerated procedure. If the client is solvent, his application is approved in a few days.\nSoon, we intend to introduce an online platform where customers will be able, based on their needs and financial capabilities, to choose the apartment they are interested in from the available options and apply for a loan online, which will speed up the process even more.\nThe favorable lending conditions also have the opposite side: very strict requirements are presented to the borrower and the property. Will the average borrower be able to use Ameriabank's mortgage loans?\nOur main requirement is solvency - the availability of sufficient income to repay the loan. We have abandoned the approach where the value of the collateral is more important than the solvency of the client. I should mention that some borrowers have misconceptions about lending. the first is that solvency is not important if there is collateral, the second is that banks aim to expropriate the client's property. Let me emphasize again that the banking business is not the sale of collateral. Banking business is making loans and making profit from it. And this means that if the loan is repaid on time, the bank will only profit and provide these funds to another client. Let's agree that this is much easier and more profitable than the hassle of selling even the most expensive and quality property.\nAt the same time, it is important for us the quality, location and location of the property, liquidity, regardless of the loan-collateral ratio.\nWe have a very flexible prepayment policy. The down payment can be 10% of the apartment value if the apartment is in a newly built building. Combining all the conditions, we get a very interesting offer. For example, if the customer wants to take a loan for 20 years to buy an apartment worth 25 million AMD, the advance payment will be 2.5 million AMD, the average monthly repayment will be around 240 thousand AMD. If the family's total documented income is 500-600 thousand AMD, they can afford to buy that apartment. And for 25 million AMD you can buy a 2-3 room apartment in the new buildings of Yerevan today. Most of our deals are concluded in the middle price segment.\nDoes Ameriabank prefer to lend for the purchase of apartments in newly constructed buildings?\nWe prefer to credit what our customers choose. We finance the acquisition as well as the development of various classes of real estate. But in any case, the purchase of an apartment is much more affordable, so the demand is concentrated in this segment. And we are where our customers are.\nI think that the main change in the real estate market in the future will not be the construction of individual buildings, as now, but of new districts. Such districts, each of which will have its own infrastructure, in which all conditions will be created for residents. Housing construction is also developing in marzes. new apartment buildings are being built, and we also plan to finance the acquisition of apartments in these buildings.\nI would also like to mention that a lot has changed in the country, people are optimistic and if you have noticed, active construction is going on everywhere in Armenia. And that means that people see the future of themselves and their children in Armenia.\nSource: news.am",

        "title": "\"I would like my son to live a peaceful and safe life in an economically developed and politically stable Armenia\"",
        "content": "\"Everyone in my family are mathematicians and engineers who had acquaintances in Silicon Valley, in the local Armenian community. Unfortunately, there was no one my age, during the first 6-7 months I had no chance to communicate with young Armenians of my age. It was very difficult for an Armenian from Armenia to integrate, Diaspora Armenians were not used to seeing Armenians moving to the USA, I felt like a stranger. Even visiting an Armenian church did not help. When I spoke pure Armenian, people were surprised because they were not used to hearing Armenian, they spoke English to each other, and Armenian only in a narrow family environment, with their parents.\"\nMaybe, Suren thought, it would be easier to integrate into the Armenian community in Los Angeles, but when he finally moved, he had already lived in the US for 8 years and knew that the diaspora was not his place. According to Suren, maybe that is the reason why he always wanted to return to Armenia.\n\"If I had gone to Los Angeles from the very beginning, maybe I would have stayed there. Honestly, I'm grateful that we settled in San Jose first, because that's where I first felt that I didn't belong in the US.\"\nAfter graduating from the University of California, Santa Barbara and an MBA from Pepperdine University, Suren worked as a budget analyst for 2 years. After living in the USA for 10 years, in 2009, he returned to Armenia for a short time and found a job as a business analyst here, which paved the way for him to a more complex and interesting job in Ukraine, where he worked for 18 months in the development center of Deutsche Bank. It helped him land his dream job in New York.\n\"When I moved to New York, I was older and I didn't feel the need to be constantly actively involved in the Armenian Diaspora, as I was when I was 17, when we had just moved to the USA. Now I was a more mature person, I knew what I needed. New York has a very strong Armenian community, but people don't interact much with each other because the city is big, people live far from each other. There is a large Armenian church in Manhattan, but not everyone comes to Sunday services. I was working as an IT business analyst and project manager in New York until I got an offer from Ameriabank.\"\nAccording to Suren, life in New York is very difficult. Dynamic commuting and work take up all the time, and the fact that the Armenian diaspora is scattered throughout the city also makes it difficult to find a spouse. In addition, in 2008, Suren's parents had returned to Armenia and he missed them very much, so he decided to return to Armenia himself and start all over again.\n\"My parents started to convince me to come back, they said that if I find a job, everything will be fine, so after working in New York for three and a half years, I applied to Ameriabank and got a job offer. To be honest, I was very doubtful because I was happy with my current job and the move meant I would have to give up a great opportunity, but I had heard so many good things about Ameriabank and finally decided to take the risk. I am very grateful that my decision justified itself.\"\nSuren currently works at Ameriabank as a Senior Project Manager (Innovation and Digital Solutions Department). He is entrusted with projects implemented at the level of the entire organization. Suren has 2-5 business meetings a day, constantly reviews and improves projects according to the requirements. Suren is very satisfied with his new job, the environment of the organization and says that working at Ameriabank forces him to strive for perfection every day. According to him, the professional growth and development of employees are in the first place at Ameriabank, and what he likes the most is that the management always supports employees at Ameriabank, and the work itself provides an opportunity to overcome new challenges every day.\n\"We don't have time to be bored. Every day new ideas, new challenges. At Ameriabank, I implement CRM-projects at the level of the entire bank. In the US, such projects are usually implemented by large consulting firms, but here I have the opportunity to manage them myself with the support of my invaluable colleagues.\"\nSuren's work in Armenia was a turning point in his life.\n“During the first few weeks of working at Ameriabank, my workplace was located next to the marketing and PR teams. More specifically, I was sitting next to my future spouse. My marriage played a huge role in my decision to stay in Armenia.\"\nFor Suren, one of the biggest challenges of working in Armenia was not being able to schedule a 9:00 a.m. meeting. Now, 3 years later, he is already used to it and has discovered the many advantages of living in his homeland: he can go to work on foot, meet his friends at any time, even if only 20 minutes before, he can be sure that he can preserve his Armenian identity. Every day is a new opening page for Suren, full of new discoveries and challenges.\n\"I have only one wish for the future. I would like my son to live a peaceful and safe life in an economically developed and politically stable Armenia.\"\nSource: RepatArmenia",

        "title": "Ameriabank is ready for changes in the labor market",
        "content": "Interview with Ophelia Kamalyan, Head of the Talent Attracting Department of \"Ameriabank\" CJSC\nThe labor market of the financial and banking sector is undergoing dynamic development. What changes have happened recently?\nThe financial and banking market in Armenia has always been a desirable employer and will continue to be so for a long time. Along with the economic changes, the banking system is also changing. The labor market is not exempt from such changes. Today, the banking system needs IT specialists much more than specialists with financial knowledge. Ameriabank acts as a financial and technical organization and in the labor market we compete with both financial and IT companies. Moreover, good specialists are less than required, and we are struggling to attract them from both leading Armenian and well-established international companies. Thanks to the development of information technologies, our specialists can easily find work in international companies, which often apply for outsourcing services. Thus, Armenia is able to compete in international markets in terms of salaries and bonuses. Professional preferences of young people have changed. If in the past young people preferred financial and economic education, now they are more inclined to get technical education. As a result, finding financial professionals may become a problem in the future. That's why we think in advance to train the necessary professionals to achieve our business goals.\nWhat difficulties do you face when recruiting new employees and what is the bank's policy in this area?\nOur task is to attract qualified specialists, and the staffing culture is constantly changing. As I mentioned, we are a financial and technical organization and we are looking for people who can apply their creative thinking equally in both financial and technical fields. Ameriabank is a leader in the field of digital banking operations, and we strive to attract professionals who can develop flexible solutions, taking into account the demands of the modern economy, in order to provide a high-quality and convenient service for our customers. As a result of the active growth policy adopted by the bank's strategy, new jobs are created. In 2018 alone, we created more than 300 jobs. I believe that this dynamic will be maintained, given the pace of our development. Over the past year, the number of our customers has doubled.\nToday, the bank has more than 900 employees who are carriers of unique corporate culture and values. As a result of the changes in the value system of the new generation, the selection and adaptation of new employees has become quite difficult. But our team succeeds because we are flexible and never stop learning and sharing our experience.\nIf we talk about difficulties, of course there are and they are not few. We are not yet known in the tech industry job market, which is why the candidates we want are not applying to us. Instead we address them ourselves. We have some difficulties in searching for unique specialists in Armenia.\nWe also actively cooperate with the Diaspora and are ready to support young professionals educated abroad to return to Armenia and invest their money in the development of our company and the economy of Armenia. We have managed to attract specialists from Lebanon, Syria and the USA, and we are glad that they are no longer connecting their lives and activities with Armenia. We cooperate with specialized universities (including technical ones), organize visits to the bank for students and schoolchildren, have discussions with them. All this allows them to understand what a job at Ameriabank can give them. American University of Armenia, Stepanavan H. have already participated in the mentioned programs. Tumanyan High School, British International School of Armenia, Armenian-Russian (Slavic) University and other educational institutions. Students studying both in Armenia and abroad have the opportunity to complete the mandatory internship at Ameriabank. In this regard, we cooperate with the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU), the International Armenian Women's Association (AIWA), \"Depi Hayk\" Foundation and other organizations that can bring young people living abroad to Armenia. Our specialists communicate without any difficulty with young people who do not speak Armenian well or at all. We are able to work in three languages. This circumstance also contributes to repatriation to some extent, which makes us very happy.\nWe can proudly say that we have already started the 11th \"Ameria Generation\" program. Through this program, we have involved more than 200 young professionals in 6 years. We plan to implement at least two such programs within a year. The program itself is unique and constantly changing. The purpose of the program is to enable young people to apply the theoretical knowledge acquired at the university in practice. Our most skilled specialists share their experience with them. No less important is the fact that Ameriabank pays salaries to the participants of the program. In our culture, it is customary to empower, educate and support young people. As a result of legislative changes, in the last two programs, we raised the age limit from 25 to 27 years, so that young people can participate in the program after compulsory military service. We are glad that the youth appreciated our step and we already have such participants.\nHow do you motivate your employees to remain loyal to the bank in the face of fierce competition for professionals?\nSince we are the leader of the banking system, we try not only to attract qualified professionals, but also to do everything to make them stay and work with us. We implement motivation systems adopted in international best practice, we have excellent office conditions where it is pleasant to work. We provide employees with sports club memberships, medical and vehicle insurance, and in some cases accident insurance. The bank carries out professional training of employees at its own expense, gives them the opportunity to participate in international conferences, international certification programs. Our employees have the opportunity to use banking services on special, beneficial terms. We organize many team-building events, thanks to which employees get a chance to experience the united team spirit. I would also like to emphasize that everyone at Ameriabank, regardless of their position, is free to express their opinion on any issue, may disagree with the manager, and this is perceived as normal. When looking for new employees, we're not looking for like-minded people. On the contrary, we are looking for people who think differently and approach work, have a different worldview, people who complement us rather than repeat us.\nSource: www.lragir.am",

        "content": "Interview with Ara Sargsyan, Head of the Financial Institutions Department of the Assets, Liabilities and Capital Management Service of \"Ameriabank\" CJSC\nMr. Sargsyan, Ameriabank attracts a significant amount of funds from international financial institutions. What does this indicate - a high level of trust in the Bank or simply a mutually beneficial cooperation?\nAt the heart of any transaction is always the mutual benefit of the transaction. At the same time, regardless of the commercial conditions, the extent to which investors and lenders trust us and believe in our success story is also very important. Since 2008, we have raised over $1 billion from international financial institutions. I believe that the indicated volume of funds and the number of our international partners are the best proof of our partners' confidence in Ameriabank's activities, programs and means of their implementation. By the way, I should mention that we cooperate with all leading international financial institutions. Two of our old and good partners, EBRD and ADB, have become shareholders of Ameriabank, once again confirming the level of trust that we have gained as a result of long-term cooperation.\nTwo conflicting opinions are regularly heard regarding the creditworthiness of Armenia's economy. some experts believe that the economy is suffocating without credit, while another believes that the economy is over-leveraged. And what do you think?\nFirst of all, I would like to note that the ratio of loans to GDP in Armenia is 45%, which is significantly lower than the same indicator of developed countries. That's why I don't think that the Armenian economy is over-credited. Of course, one can disagree with those who believe that businesses and consumers do not need loans at all, but there is no one answer that is absolutely right for all cases. It is impossible to imagine business development without loans. For many people, a loan is the only way to buy a house or a car. As a rule, these loans justify themselves and bring considerable benefit to people. In addition, consumer loans also stimulate the growth of consumer demand and, therefore, the economy, which is definitely a positive factor. However, this question has another side. Sometimes people end up in debt as a result of reckless and unjustified spending. As a rule, this happens in the case of a line of credit with cards. In this case, in fact, it is more correct to talk about improving the general level of financial literacy and financial discipline, and not about over-indebtedness of the economy.\nAs a result of each new transaction and the growth of Ameriabank's capital, funds from foreign financial markets become even more accessible to you. What opportunities does this create for the Bank's clients and, in general, the economy of Armenia?\nVery good question. Acting as a financial intermediary, Ameriabank provides the borrowed funds from international institutions to the borrowers, creating additional value for both local small and medium-sized businesses and the RA economy in general. Ameriabank was awarded the highest rating by global rating agencies such as Moody's and S&P. Thanks to this rating, we are able to get loans in foreign currency and AMD on the most favorable terms. We cooperate with more than 2 dozen institutional investors, which allows us to have a diversified portfolio of wholesale financing. Due to this, our customers, and therefore the RA economy, have the opportunity to receive loans in the necessary volume and at competitive interest rates, and the most promising branches of the economy and companies with great growth potential are able to benefit from our financial support.\nCooperation with international financial institutions does not only involve attracting funds. It allows applying international best practices. From this point of view, what impact has cooperation with international financial institutions had on Ameriabank?\nCooperation with institutional investors is definitely much more than just raising funds. The current high level of our relations with international financial institutions was formed due to 2 main factors. they are the continuous improvement of the corporate governance system and the constant provision of a certain level of financial indicators. I should mention that cooperating with foreign partners is not easy, but at the same time it is very effective. We need the right incentives and benchmarks to drive that collaborative pace. The pursuit of the best international practices is in our DNA, which allows us to ensure the continuous growth of Ameriabank for more than ten years. Working under the supervision of a local regulatory body is a huge responsibility in itself, but I think you will agree with me that working within complex and multi-faceted contracts is much more difficult. I am sure that we have chosen the right strategy of active cooperation with international financial institutions. It is very important for us and allows us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, provide stable buffer capital, sufficient liquidity positions, and have a high-quality accountability system in accordance with IAS. And at the basis of all this, of course, are the exclusive systems of risk management and corporate management implemented in our Bank.",

        "title": "Ratings are for investors, not banks. Hovhannes Khachatryan",
        "content": "- Why do banks use the services of rating agencies?\n- Any investor, be it an institutional, corporate investor or an individual depositor, wants to know how creditworthy the organization he has chosen is. To get this information, the investor can study the bank's financial indicators, reports in detail (which is also highly desirable) or can simply make a decision based on the ratings given to financial companies by reputable organizations.\nThere are few such companies in the world. As a rule, when talking about rating agencies, we mean the \"Big Three\" of international rating agencies. they are Moody's Investor Service, Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Ratings agencies. Ameriabank was rated by Moody's and S&P agencies, and other Armenian banks by Moody's and Fitch agencies. For example, Moody's agency awarded Ameriabank and confirmed this week a В1 rating for long-term deposits in national currency with a \"positive\" outlook. By comparing this rating with the ratings of other financial institutions, the investor or depositor can get an idea of ​​the reliability of the given financial institution.\n- What is the reason that not all banks cooperate with rating agencies?\n-Unlike foreign investors, local investors and depositors pay much less attention to ratings.\nTherefore, for banks that actively attract funds from international financial institutions or through capital market instruments, having a rating is much more important than for banks that are not involved in any way with large international investments. Maybe some of them are sure that they will not get a high rating, and that is the reason why they do not apply to rating agencies. There is also a third option, when the company applies to the rating agency, but does not publish the rating awarded because it is low.\n- There are cases when companies refuse the services of rating agencies. What does this indicate?\n- There is nothing strange when the rating agency confirms the rating, and the company simultaneously refuses the services of the given rating agency. Sometimes this is due to competition between rating agencies (quality of service and price). And if the company refuses the services of the agency due to disagreement with the result, and it is done without the approval of the rating, which the agency necessarily mentions, then in such cases the market's reaction is, of course, negative.\n- To what extent does the country's sovereign rating affect the company's rating?\n- All Armenian financial and non-financial organizations operating in the RA economic system, when applying to rating agencies, cannot expect a rating that exceeds the sovereign rating of Armenia. Exceptions may be made in cases where the company's business risks are for some reason less related to Armenia (for example, the proportion of foreign operations is high), or the parent company located abroad has a higher rating. In all other cases, the country's sovereign rating is the maximum result that any company can expect. Currently, Ameriabank has the highest possible rating in Armenia, which matches the country's sovereign rating.\n- Based on what criteria do rating agencies give ratings to banks?\n- There are types of banking risks. they are credit, liquidity, interest rate, currency, operational and other risks. Rating agencies evaluate all the mentioned parameters on the appropriate scale. They examine the bank's financial statements and require detailed information. In addition, they visit the bank and carry out a Due Diligence assessment of the bank's financial condition and all elements of banking risks in order to establish a single rating. I would like to note that non-financial parameters are also taken into account, such as, for example, the quality of corporate governance, the structure of share capital, the presence of institutional investors among the bank's shareholders and many other factors.\n- Fitch Ratings agency raised the long-term default rating of Georgia, a foreign currency issuer. Many people in Armenia have a question as to why the rating of Armenia, which is currently 2 points lower than the rating of Georgia, does not increase.\n- There is a certain procedure for revising the rating, which has its own deadlines. In practice, a rating agency's positive outlook (which is present in the case of Armenia) remains valid for 18 months, and it usually starts to be revised (upgraded or downgraded) after about a year. I believe that in the coming months, Armenia's sovereign rating may be revised, and according to my predictions, taking into account institutional reforms, maintaining financial stability and increasing economic activity, there is a high probability that Armenia's rating will increase.\nSource: www.tert.am",

        "content": "Ameriabank was once again recognized as the winner in the \"Best Investment Bank in Armenia\" category of Global Finance magazine. Shushanik Hovsepyan, Head of the Bank's Capital Markets Department, presented details.\nWhat indicators guide the selection of the winner in the given category?\nCandidates in the \"Best Investment Bank\" nomination are evaluated based on a number of criteria. namely, the ability to implement investment banking transactions, market share, number and volume of executed transactions, innovative solutions used by the bank, the bank's reputation, the wide network of financial organizations cooperating with the bank, etc.\nIs the quality of service also evaluated?\nYes. That is one of the key criteria. I can say that Ameriabank is the only company providing investment services in the Armenian market, which has separate specialized divisions serving clients in the directions of Capital Markets, Acquisitions and Mergers and Corporate Finance.\nIn your opinion, what is the first thing that distinguishes Ameriabank's investment banking direction?\nWith innovation and bold solutions. Ameriabank's investment banking operations team has always stood out for its unprecedented projects in the Armenian market. Ameriabank has implemented the largest deal of public placement of corporate bonds in Armenia, organized the first issues of bonds in Armenian drams for international financial institutions - IFC (International Finance Corporation) and EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development). Moreover, the IFC bond placement project is considered the first project of securities issuance and placement by a non-resident organization in Armenia. The first floating rate bond issue and placement project in Armenia for the EBRD was also implemented by Ameriabank.\nI would like to note that Ameriabank, as the issuer, is the market leader in the number and volume of issued bonds. Bank issues make up 30% of the RA corporate bond market. Currently, 11 issues of Ameriabank are in circulation, the total volume of which is more than 90 million USD.\nWhy is cooperation with various financial institutions considered one of the most important criteria for evaluating an investment bank?\nOnly partnership relations formed with various financial institutions and a large base of potential investors enable the investment bank to effectively carry out its activities. Thanks to this, Ameriabank's Corporate Finance team is able to offer clients the greatest opportunities to attract investors and the most diverse structured financing solutions. Today, Ameriabank cooperates with all international financial institutions operating in the region and has attracted more than 700 million US dollars from them, both for itself and for the companies that are its clients.\nThe award given to Ameriabank in the \"Best Investment Bank\" category for the fourth year in a row by Global Finance magazine also proves that the bank provides international-class investment banking services, is ready to fully meet market demand, regardless of product and transaction complexity, and also confirms that in this direction, the bank has chosen the right strategy.",

So far, S&P Global Ratings has not awarded a sovereign rating to the Republic of Armenia.\nAccording to S&P Global Ratings, Armenia's sovereign creditworthiness reflects the limitations of the bank's rating, that is, the bb- rating of Ameriabank's own creditworthiness (stand-alone credit profile (SACP)) is one step higher than the long-term B+ rating.\nAmeriabank's credit rating reflects Ameriabank's position as Armenia's largest bank and S&P Global Ratings' expectations that the bank will maintain its leading position and capitalization level will increase over the next 24 months due to stable income.\nThe rating's stable outlook for the next 12 months reflects S&P Global Ratings' forecasts that the bank's operations and financial indicators will be stable during the specified period due to its strong market position and the improvement of Armenia's macroeconomic environment.\nAccording to S&P Global Ratings, Armenia's banking sector will be stable, without noticeable market distortions. The sector risk trend is also assessed as stable.\nS&P Global Ratings considers credit risk a factor negatively affecting Armenia's banking sector, given the higher weight of foreign currency loans, especially unhedged loans to individuals and legal entities, than in comparable countries, and the fact that Armenia's judicial system is not yet fully established. S&P Global Ratings assesses the economic risk trend of Armenia's banking sector as stable.\nThe agency also notes that during the previous 6 years, Ameriabank had good profitability indicators, in particular, the average return on assets was 1.4%, and the ratio of costs to income in 2017 was as of the end it was 40%, which is quite a good indicator compared to local and foreign banks.\nAccording to S&P Global Ratings, Ameriabank has a good chance of maintaining its leading position in Armenia, given the favorable macroeconomic environment and its improvement, as well as a professional management team and a highly capable controlling shareholder with extensive experience in banking and finance.",

        "title": "There have been no bank defaults in Armenia for 16 years",
        "content": "About how the RA banking system differs from the Russian banking system, that technologies are the driving force of the RA banking system, and what plans Ameriabank has regarding market consolidation, Ameriabank's Assets, Liabilities and Capital manager told in an interview to \"Банковское обозрение\" magazine. Hovhannes Khachatryan, head of the management department.\n— How does the RA banking system differ from the Russian banking system?\n— The first difference is that there are no state banks in the RA banking system, it is completely private. Because of this, there is fierce competition. There are international banks on the market (\"HBS\", \"VTB\", \"Credit Agricole\", etc.), with which local banks compete effectively. Among them is Ameriabank, which is a private bank and has been leading the market for several years.\nThe second difference is that the regulation is much stricter in Armenia, due to which there have been no cases of bank default in the last 16 years. The late 1990s and early 2000s can be characterized as a period of \"purging\", as a result of which regulation became even more stringent.\nOur market is more liberal than the Russian one, for example, there is no currency control. The lack of bank financing of large government infrastructure projects can be seen as both a positive and a negative aspect. In other words, in this sense, banks are more protected from risks.\nFrom the point of view of technological development, the leaders of the Russian banking system are more developed. We have a lot to learn from them in this regard. This is perhaps explained by the more conservative approach of the country's leadership to various innovations, as well as, in individual cases, the heads of various banks.\n— Have special relations been formed between the RA and RF banking systems?\n— We have very good relations with our partners in Russian banks. Despite the fact that the economies of our countries are inter-integrated, I would not say that the RA and RF banking systems are in close interaction. VTB Bank's presence in the Armenian market is small, it mainly includes the retail sector.\nWhen designing the data management center, we asked for backup space with a growth outlook of another 3-4 years.\n— The next question concerns technologies. This year Softline company built a data processing center for Ameriabank. What kind of banking services is it for?\n— Today, the banking system is undergoing radical changes. It is already clear that banks will not be limited to selling only financial services. For example, the Russian Sberbank has already appeared on the market as a platform through which the client can use a huge number of services on a one-stop basis. The task of the bank is to offer the client such services that the latter will most likely buy. Business analytics, artificial intelligence and other related technologies and approaches are used for this purpose. Banks have accumulated huge amounts of data. We see and understand the need to process that data quickly and sophisticatedly as we realize what the future holds. Of course, first of all, this refers to the most advanced solutions in the field of retail products, online lending, mobile banking and other remote channels. At this point, it is important to be able to work with existing data and enrich it using information from different sources. All this, in turn, creates new requirements for working with data, for applications designed to process them, as well as for the productivity of computing and network equipment.\nBig data can also be used for marketing decisions and setting credit limits. Scorecards can also be improved with these technologies. The infrastructure created as a result of the opening of the new data processing center will allow all of this to happen. When commissioning this project, we asked the consultant to provide spare space and capacity for installed equipment, center engineering, and network bandwidth with a growth outlook of another 3-4 years.\n— Is loan decision-making now automated?\n- Partially. The decision-making process for some products is fully automated. We want to make more decisions in an automated way and apply this method not only to individuals, but to SMEs. The experience of our partners (including Russian partners) shows that perfect scoring algorithms not only exclude the human factor (this is obvious within the automation process), but also reduce the bank's risks.\n— Can information technology be considered an important factor of competition?\n— They are still not considered an important element of competition in our market. Along with all this, customers dictate their terms to us based on their requirements and daily habits. If in the past it was necessary to make efforts to get them to start using certain technologies, today they are already demanding innovations, because the customer base is younger and more technologically literate. All these mobile apps, online banking services, personal transfers are a must-have part of banking services for customers, especially the growing generation. Moreover, Armenian banks still mainly work with old service mechanisms. Some banks are not in a hurry to acquire new technologies. This applies especially to small banks, for which making such a decision is very difficult and expensive. Such expenses are not always justified. However, the future is in any case new technologies, and one fine day when they will no longer be indispensable, the lagging banks will not be able to acquire and implement the entire range of the latest technologies in one day. The information technologies of the banking sector must be constantly improved and together with the customers, reach a level that can be registered in 10 years.\nRegarding the use of remote services by legal entities, there are still no specialized appropriate decisions in Armenia.\n— The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has a share in the capital of Ameriabank. Is the impact of the EBRD felt in any way?\n— In addition to the EBRD, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) also has a stake in the capital of our Bank since February 2018. These organizations are of great importance for local (for example, Armenian) financial markets, because they set high standards of activity, which need to be met not only to get credit, but in the best cases to have a share in the statutory capital. The high standards set relate to risk management, management and financial reporting, and corporate and social responsibility. Even if they don't directly teach us how to meet those standards, we simply constantly improve ourselves to meet their demands. Since our Bank plans to make a primary public placement in the near future and go to international platforms, this is the level of transparency and regulation that we are used to working with the mentioned organizations. Sometimes they organize information exchange with other banks (EBRD partners). We often have guests from Russian, Central Asian and other banks, and our specialists, in turn, make return visits to the mentioned financial organizations. Everything is interesting to us, we are constantly learning, and EBRD and ADB allow us to exchange experience.\n— Does Ameriabank plan to establish a presence in other countries?\n— We have never hidden our ambitions to enter the Russian and Georgian markets. There were real attempts, which, unfortunately or fortunately, were not successful, and we concentrated our efforts in Armenia. It gave its result. we have been leading the corporate sector for years with a one-third market share. Now we are starting to take leading positions in the SME and retail lending sectors as well. It should be noted that the opportunities of the Armenian market are quite limited. On the other hand, the economy of our country is relatively stable and more predictable in the medium and long term. However, nothing is ruled out. After the consolidation process in the RA banking sector is completed, and it ends in our favor, a redistribution of resources may take place, and the process of entering foreign markets will begin. We may come back to this question soon.\n— Banks in Russia often enter other markets, including non-bank ones. Is Ameriabank taking any steps in this direction?\n— We are a financial institution, our capabilities and strengths are concentrated in the financial sector. At the moment, we have no intention of trying our hand at other fields. However, theoretically, I do not rule out attempts to enter any other non-banking market. However, in any case, we will not direct our resources to an area that we cannot cope with. There are types of cooperation between financial and some non-financial organizations that are considered as synergies (for example, in the field of telecommunications). In this case, the merger is not necessary, there can be a close cooperation. But now we are still fighting for the title of absolute leader in the financial sector.\n— What is the percentage of use of remote services at the moment? Which service option is preferred: visits to the bank or online service?\n— One third of the bank's customers actively use our mobile application or internet banking, one part (25%) quite actively for the purpose of making transactions, the other part simply to monitor accounts and receive information. However, this indicator is growing very fast. Regarding the use of remote services by legal entities, there are still no specialized appropriate decisions in Armenia. For large companies, this issue is not critical, but there is a demand for remote services among a significant number of small and medium-sized enterprises, and we should be able to meet this demand in a short time.\n \nSource: \"Банковское обозрение\"",

        "title": "Moody's international rating agency awarded Ameriabank a B1 rating",
        "content": "The prestigious Moody's international rating agency awarded Ameriabank the following ratings.\nB1 rating of long-term deposits in national currency, \nB2 rating for long-term deposits in foreign currency, \nlong-term counterparty risk rating Ba3.\n \nThe B1 rating of long-term deposits in national currency has a positive outlook based on the positive outlook of the B1 rating of government debt.\nB2 rating of long-term foreign currency deposits is the maximum possible rating for Armenian banks, limited by the maximum threshold of foreign currency deposits of the Republic of Armenia. The rating has a stable outlook.\nRating justifications\nThe rating of long-term deposits in national currency awarded to Ameriabank reflects:\nthe bank's diversified business directions and strong positions in the local market \nimproved asset quality and ability to absorb potential losses due to adequate capital buffers, high profitability and adequate NPL coverage; \nsufficient level of liquidity and diversified sources of attracting funds. At the same time, Ameriabank's rating is limited by Armenia's macroeconomic indicators and the significant share of loans in foreign currency.\n \nAccording to Moody's, Ameriabank's asset quality will remain generally stable for the foreseeable future, given the improvement in economic conditions and Moody's expectations that in 2018-2019 the national currency will be stable.\nWhen setting the ratings, Moody's based a number of important indicators. In particular, the share of non-performing loans in the total loan portfolio decreased. As of 31.03.2018, that indicator was 3.9%, compared to 2017. compared to 4.1% at the end of the year, the coverage ratio of problem loans in 2018 in the first quarter was 87%, in 2017 compared to 57% at the end of the year. At the same time, the share of foreign currency loans at the end of the year was high at 82%, which leads to the sensitivity of asset quality to exchange rate fluctuations. But on the other hand, a significant part of these borrowers are exporters who provide foreign currency income, which partially reduces the credit risk arising from exchange rate fluctuations.\nMoody's also highlighted the fact that Ameriabank has a diversified shareholding structure and can attract additional capital if necessary. In particular, thanks to the investment of the Asian Development Bank in 2018 The bank's equity capital was replenished with USD 30 million. Normative index of capital adequacy in 2018. in the first quarter was 14.05%, and in accordance with the requirements of Basel I - around 19%. 2018 in the first quarter, the bank's net profit was AMD 2.56 billion (56% increase compared to the same period in 2017). As a result, the average annual return on assets was 1.5%, the return on capital was 13.4%.\nMoody's expects that the Bank's profitability growth trend will be maintained in the foreseeable future, in the next 12-18 months, due to the fact that the Bank's credit strategy will be focused on the development of more profitable retail banking operations.\nMoody's also noted that the Bank's liquidity and leverage will be stable over the next 12-18 months due to well-diversified liabilities, a large pool of liquid assets and alternative sources of liquidity (such as funds from international financial organizations). Moody's also highlights that customer funds are around 64% of the Bank's liabilities, half of which are retail deposits. The bank has a sufficient liquidity reserve consisting of funds and government securities, which in 2018 accounted for more than 22% of total assets in the first quarter.\nAmeriabank's national currency long-term deposit global B1 rating (GLC) includes Moody's assessment that the probability of government support if necessary is high due to the fact that Ameriabank is a systemically important bank with a large customer base and large market share ( 17% according to loans to customers, 13% according to customer deposits). On the other hand, this support does not imply an increase in the global rating in national currency, as the bank's basic credit rating (BCA) is already equal to Armenia's B1 rating.\nPositive rating outlook\nThe B1 rating of long-term deposits in the national currency of the bank has a positive outlook, which coincides with the positive outlook of the B1 rating of the RA state debt.",

        "content": "Armenia, Yerevan (May 7, 2018). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \"Ameriabank\" CJSC have signed an agreement for the acquisition of 30 million US dollars of equity participation in order to strengthen the banking system of Armenia and expand access to financial services in the country. This is ADB's first equity acquisition transaction in Armenia. ADB also approved a loan of up to USD 30 million to Ameriabank.\nThe contract was signed by ADB Armenia Office Director Shane Rosenthal and Ameriabank Board of Directors Chairman Andrey Mkrtchyan during the contract signing ceremony held in Yerevan.\n\"We are happy to invest in Ameriabank. \"Cooperating with the dynamic team of Ameriabank, we will support the expansion of credit volumes for small and medium enterprises, thus contributing to the growth and development of Armenia,\" said Mr. Rosenthal.\nAmeriabank's role in the development of Armenia's economy and banking system, stable indicators of the effectiveness of the bank's activities over the last ten years, as well as the bank's active efforts to raise the standard of living of the society were the impetus for the said significant transaction. Ameriabank leads the list of leaders of the RA banking system by all main financial indicators. The bank is also the largest lender in Armenia. As of the first quarter of 2018, the bank's assets amounted to 1.4 billion USD.\n\"We highly appreciate this new level of partnership relations, which testify to ADB's deep trust in Ameriabank. This initiative will provide an additional incentive for the implementation of the bank's strategic goals and long-term plans, and will also greatly contribute to the expansion of access to international capital markets in the near future. I am sure that our joint efforts will allow to develop the banking system of Armenia and contribute to the economic growth of the country in general and the development of the SME sector in particular,\" said Andrey Mkrtchyan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ameriabank.\nAccess to finance in Armenia is a serious problem, especially for SMEs and micro-enterprises, despite their significant role in the Armenian economy. SMEs make up the majority of the country's enterprises, while their share in GDP and employment indicators is small (43% and 41.7%, respectively).\nStrengthening the banking system of Armenia will allow providing affordable financing for SMEs and developing private financial services, expanding Ameriabank's financial capabilities to serve SMEs. In particular, the mentioned program will allow Ameriabank to provide sustainable financing to SMEs, thus contributing to the creation of new jobs by the latter and the growth and diversification of the RA economy.\nAs part of the financing package, ADB also plans to provide Ameriabank with a technical assistance grant to support digital banking technologies, IT systems and risk management.\nThe Asian Development Bank, headquartered in Manila, aims to reduce poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. ADB was founded in 1966 and has 67 members, 48 ​​of which are from the Asian region.\nYou can visit www.adb.org for more information",

        "title": "Davit Sargsyan's interview",
        "content": "David Sargsyan, \nHead of Legal Advisory Services of Ameria Group of Companies\nMr. Sargsyan, why did you choose law as a profession?\nYou ask a difficult question. No one in my family practiced law, so it wasn't a family tradition, just my decision, which, by the way, I made following the rule of exception. My father was a civil engineer and he did everything to introduce me to the field of engineering. There came a point, however, when he realized that my humanitarian abilities were stronger than my mathematical abilities, and he supported me when I chose the field of law and succeeded in that field.\nWhat are the skills that a top lawyer like you should have? Are there any personal qualities that made you what you are now?\nThank you for the appreciation. There are many lawyers in the market today, and I am one of them, maybe successful in one field or another, because people tend to specialize in certain fields. I think the biggest and most important qualities, regardless of profession, are: continuous development and self-improvement, a broad understanding of the situation and a non-standard way of thinking. These are the main qualities that I have acquired especially by studying in Western educational institutions. Unfortunately, understanding in Armenia today is based on the rule of \"yes\" or \"no\", that is, either you can do something or you can't. People do not make an effort to study the rule from different angles, to form a multifaceted understanding of it, which would allow the rule to be applied as an innovative solution. I am convinced that this ability is very important for the Armenian market, and this is the secret of Ameria's success: we find solutions that others do not find and do not even try to find.\nWhat are the trump cards or features, thanks to which \"Ameria\" group of companies has become one of the market leaders?\nIn addition to non-standard thinking and innovative solutions, Ameria is always at the customer's side, always with the customer and working for the customer. At the heart of everything is service, moreover, service must be performed at the highest level, and this is a mandatory requirement; if any team member does not fit Ameria's customer-centric values ​​and principles, we do not accept that person's services. At Ameria, we always meet the highest quality standards.\n\"Ameria\" legal service provides legal advice in various branches of the economy. According to you, what is the most difficult branch in terms of the existing legal framework?\nI would emphasize not on the branches of the economy, but on existing or absent legal acts and concepts in Armenia. In particular, we need to develop the legislation governing the share sector so that we can conclude appropriate share agreements. For example, there are many issues related to shareholders that are not regulated by the current RA legislation, instead we have to regulate them at the contractual level. Another hot issue is the partnership between the public and private sectors, which we urgently need to develop and which can play a decisive role in terms of foreign investment. By the way, \"Ameria\" has a significant contribution in this field.\nOf the many cases you have won, which ones are you particularly proud of?\nI wouldn't use the word \"win\", rather Ameria had a stake in those cases and successfully completed the deal. Personally, for me and my team, I think the most important transaction was the entry of \"Contour Global\" into Armenia. This was a significant Western investment that brought diversity to the RA energy sector. The transaction itself was very complex and dynamic, at all stages we continuously cooperated with other lawyers and international experts. Before we prepared the deal, reached a preliminary agreement, and finally closed it, several years passed, during which our knowledge base grew incomparably.\nYou were at the beginning of the formation of the RA securities market. How would you rate the progress made since the 90s and the challenges of today?\nYes, we have worked in this area within the USAID initiative. I was working with the company that won the competition. However, we still have a lot of room to grow because, unfortunately, the stock market is not as active as we would like. Of course, the legislative field has developed: the rules have been simplified, the procedures have been regulated, the field has become more comprehensible. We have a number of companies listed on the market, bonds are circulating. On the other hand, I think that in order to develop the securities market, the economy of Armenia must first develop. At the moment, the market is too small, and I think regional companies should also play a significant role in establishing this industry.\nThe RA government proposes to amend the Law on Investments. In your opinion, can these changes contribute to the growth of foreign investment and what will be the overall impact on the country's economy?\nRA investment field legislation was developed in the first years of independence. One of the key laws, the Foreign Investment Protection Act, has long since changed. It includes a provision to establish favorable conditions for foreign investors, which excludes the application of unfavorable changes in legislation to investors for a certain period of time. Therefore, any new changes proposed now must be based on the history of the law and take into account all other changes in the legislative framework, so that it is possible to set clear rules for investors in a single tool, through which the investor can analyze the market and decide whether to enter the given market or not. : I believe that the changes carried out for this purpose can contribute to the growth of investments in the future.\nWhat impact can the amendments to the RA constitution have on corporate governance and the business environment?\nWe are now transitioning to a new constitutional government system for the country. In my opinion, this will not really affect the business as these are different industries. Corporate governance is part of private institutional development, while constitutional reforms imply a transition from a presidential system of government to a parliamentary system. Of course, if we compare, we will see that the last two are more closely related and closer to each other. I think the changes in corporate governance and business environment have nothing to do with the constitution at all, but come from the practical implementation of laws, and our laws, in my opinion, are quite modern and reflect all the trends in today's business world. We now need to improve the enforcement and enforcement models of existing laws.\nYour lady is also a lawyer. Do you have a \"marriage secret\" or guide that helps you grow and maintain your relationship?\nIt's an interesting question. My wife and I have not entered into any kind of contract, as lawyers call it, a \"prenuptial agreement\". I was once asked by a foreign client to assist in drafting his prenuptial agreement. He was German, his wife was Armenian. To his question about whether I have experience in drafting prenuptial agreements, I answered \"yes\", and to the question of how many contracts I have drawn up, I answered \"zero\". He was surprised and asked how I will deal with the matter. In fact, there is no lawyer dealing with prenuptial agreements in Armenia, this field almost does not exist in Armenia. In addition, there are unwritten rules in the family that guide us. The main rule in our family is that my wife and I do not argue about legal issues and we respect each other's opinions. We don't flaunt our strengths, we are equal. Another important factor that plays a decisive role in the relationship is that we do not interfere in each other's affairs and do not disclose information about our customers, because the market is small and there is a potential conflict of interest. In general, in some cases I have no idea about my wife's current affairs, nor she about mine. We are just discussing general ideas as experts in the field. We accept each other's position, even if we disagree.\nYour advice to young people: how to self-improve and grow?\nUnfortunately, due to lack of time, I don't teach either. Teaching was one of the main driving forces for me to connect with the younger generation, helping me to always be in touch with fresh ideas and ready to answer the most difficult questions. My advice, especially in today's globalized world with no borders and endless opportunities to learn and educate, is to be an innovative thinker, keep evolving and listen to your client while following the rules and principles of your profession.\nSource: AmCham Newsletter",

The goal of the summit is to become a stimulus for the development of the startup system. Ameriabank will also contribute to this project. \nThis year's summit has many innovations and programs that did not exist last year, including, for the first time in Armenia, the event in the format of \"Camp Fire Pitch\", during which startups will present their pitches to investors invited from Armenia and abroad. A day-long campathon has been specially developed for developers. During the week, the summit participants will also have access to many entertainment programs. \n\"We are happy that the leader of the banking system in Armenia has joined the summit as a main partner.

The formation of startups aimed at meeting the needs of customers and based on technological innovations will in turn promote the technological development of the financial sector and the expansion of the market.\n \n \n\"Startup Armenia\" foundation was founded in March 2016 by a group of enterprising young people who previously created and are still successful in a number of startups. The purpose of the fund is to support Armenian startups by organizing regular events. Pursuing this very goal, since the summer of 2016, the annual \"Sevan Startup Summit\" has been held with the efforts of the \"Startup Armenia\" foundation, which is the first tented startup conference in the world in its performance format.

It allows local banks to provide access to financing, provide business advice, train and support women entrepreneurs and managers. \nThe program components are financing, technical assistance, risk mitigation for local financial institutions through first-loss compensation during project implementation, and business advisory services aimed at supporting women-led SMEs. Technical assistance and advisory services are jointly funded by the EBRD and the governments of Luxembourg and Sweden. \nAmeriabank is one of the leading banks in Armenia and is the first in its assets, loan portfolio, customer accounts and involved deposits (according to public reports dated 30.09.16). At the beginning of the year, EBRD added to Ameriabank's shareholders by acquiring 20% ​​of the bank's shares. Ameriabank is the first Armenian financial institution to join EBRD's Women in Business program. \n\"Women are a powerful economic potential for Armenia's economy. In this regard, it is very necessary to create preconditions for their success. That is why we strive to implement this very important initiative in Armenia. Women's entrepreneurship can be a powerful stimulus for the development of the country's economy. I am confident that the provided credit line, advice, professional knowledge and methods, and non-financial support services provided by the Women in Business team will allow women entrepreneurs to develop their businesses and prosper,\" said Mark Davis, director of EBRD's Yerevan office. \n\"I welcome the EBRD's initiative to increase the role of women in the economy of Armenia. Women entrepreneurs have successfully entered and gained a dominant position in certain sectors of the SME sector in Armenia. I hope that thanks to the targeted financial support, women entrepreneurs will be able to develop their activities and enter the sectors of the Armenian economy where there is a clear gender imbalance. This program will allow SMEs to be effectively developed thanks to the provided financial and non-financial support tools, which will be a huge potential for the narrow target audience of this program,\" said Artak Hanesyan, General Director of Ameriabank. \nIn 1992 Since starting operations in Armenia, the EBRD has invested more than 1.11 billion euros and implemented 153 projects in the country's financial, corporate, infrastructure development and energy sectors. 88% of investments went to private sector financing.\n \n*** \n\"Ameriabank\" CJSC is one of the dynamically developing banks of Armenia and ranks among the country's most stable and large financial institutions.

        "title": "The smallness of the market limits the development of Armenian banks",
        "content": "YEREVAN, JULY 18, ARMENPRESS. Armenia is perceived as a \"peaceful haven\" for funds, and this is a positive sign. Armenian banks have a sufficient base of non-resident individual and legal entity clients. Most of these clients are related to the Armenian Diaspora. Hovhannes Khachatryan, head of the Assets, Liabilities and Capital Management Department of \"Ameriabank\" CJSC, mentions this, with whom \"Armenpress\" presents the interview below. \n \nMr. Khachatryan, to what extent are Armenian banks integrated with international markets? How do the changes in global financial markets affect the banking system of Armenia?\nThe main ways of integration of Armenian banks into international markets are financial infrastructure, capital market and partnership relations with individual financial institutions (B2B). From the point of view of financial infrastructure, Armenia is sufficiently integrated with international markets. I mean relations with correspondent banks, the SWIFT system, the rating of banks by Fitch and Moody's agencies, the presence of NASDAQ OMX in Armenia, etc. \nFrom the point of view of partnership relations, the mentioned connection is ensured by cooperation with international financial institutions through involved loans, trade financing instruments and various credit programs. The mentioned path of integration plays a big role in the development of the banking system of Armenia. \nHowever, the influence of the capital market is insignificant, as it is unfortunately still in the early stages of development in Armenia. In addition to operating in the domestic market, Armenian banks should consider issuing Eurobonds or initial public offerings (IPOs) on major international platforms. Ameriabank has chosen this path. We are pleased with the largest transactions concluded with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which enabled Ameriabank to significantly increase its regulatory capital. But listing on the London Stock Exchange, which is what we are trying to achieve, is another level of integration. \nRegarding the second part of your question, let me say that in a dollarized economy, the balance sheets of banks are mostly in dollars, and the interest rates of dollar funds attracted from foreign markets are, as a rule, related to the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) rate. When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, LIBOR immediately goes up, so our borrowing rates go up as well. This is a manifestation of the direct and very serious influence of foreign markets on us. By the way, in order to avoid transferring the mentioned risk to the borrowers, we partially hedge it. Such a step, of course, implies certain additional costs for banks. \nIn addition, our economy is highly dependent on the international prices of raw materials. First of all, we are talking about metal prices, which are one of the driving forces of our economy. The second important factor is energy prices, which have a great impact on the Russian economy, as well as the flow of remittances. Fluctuations in prices in international raw material markets have a significant impact on our strategic decision-making. Lending, asset quality dynamics, foreign exchange rate, inflation and interest rates are closely related to these indicators. \nA very recent example is the so-called Brexit, that is, the referendum on the withdrawal of Great Britain from the European Union. It already had a partial impact on oil and gold prices, exchange rates, and most importantly, expectations of economic entities. Since this impact on the Armenian economy and financial system occurs through the real sector (as opposed to the capital markets), the impact will therefore have a certain time lag.\nA stable base of resources allows banks to conduct a successful credit policy and, in general, to be active in the market. At the same time, attracting long-term and affordable funds from international markets has become a problem for many banks during the crisis. However, in this regard, Ameriabank is quite active, which is clearly evidenced by the bank's raising of 20 million US dollars from the German DEG company in May, and then concluding a deal with responsAbility Investments AG. How do you manage to convince foreign partners that cooperation with you is profitable?\nYes, very recently we successfully placed a USD 20 million debt security between four Luxembourg investment funds through responsAbility Investments AG. The funds generated from the placement of securities will be directed to lending to small and medium-sized enterprises in Armenia, financing renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Attracting funds from foreign markets is of great importance for us, because savings in Armenia are quite limited. Banks that do not have access to external sources are forced to rely on expensive domestic deposits, which in terms of balance sheet diversification, interest rates and terms of borrowing are incomparable to borrowing from international markets. \nThe current period is characterized by weak economic activity and the presence of certain geopolitical and economic risks. Even in such an environment, we managed to significantly increase our portfolio of funds attracted from international financial institutions and lower the interest rates of these funds. I would like to draw your attention to an important factor of our cooperation with international financial institutions. All these financial institutions present many requirements to banks, which are fixed in credit agreements. We must comply with certain financial standards: capital adequacy, credit risk, we must comply with environmental and social responsibility norms, corporate governance standards. On the one hand, this limits the freedom of action and complicates bank management in a certain way. However, at the same time, the bank's development is becoming more continuous and balanced. Our credit policy and all processes are aligned with the specified requirements (they mainly derive from European directives, as most of our partners are European financial institutions). We and our partners believe that ultimately all this is aimed at improving the quality of financial intermediation and therefore also the structure of the Armenian economy.\nBut there is another side to the question. Attracting funds is half the battle, they still need to be deployed. Are loans required? And how to maintain a balance between the bank's aspirations to increase the loan portfolio and assess credit risks?\nOne of the priority tasks of the bank is risk assessment. It is not for nothing that they say that the banking business is nothing but \"buying risks\" and \"selling risks\". Credit risks have increased amid modest economic growth, dram devaluation, and reduced remittances from Russia. At the same time, the quality credit demand has decreased. \nToday, Ameriabank has almost no limit on attracting resources. The bank's capital adequacy ratio is 18% against the norm of 12%, which enables us to significantly increase the loan portfolio. Our only limitation is our credit market, where 20 banks operate in a limited economic environment with a limited number of business projects in need of financing. Recently, two main trends have been observed in the credit market. On the one hand, there is a discrepancy in financial flows among borrowers for various reasons. Moreover, we are talking about companies with healthy, properly structured and stable foundations, which have experienced temporary difficulties in business and complications related to loan servicing. On the other hand, some banks are unwilling to continue serving their customers. In this situation, we decided to start a big credit campaign. Due to our long-term funds, we offer borrowers the most attractive conditions both in terms of credit terms and interest rates. We are already successfully implementing the mentioned program, which covers not only business loans, but also consumer and mortgage loans. Today, we are the absolute leader in the market with a 15% market share and we expect further growth of this indicator after the end of the credit campaign.\nHow do the bank's strategic plans affect the structure of assets and liabilities, and how do you manage the balance sheet, given the fact that the bank's total assets exceed USD 1 billion?\nHaving $1 billion in assets is our first step. Our strategic plans go far, and in the near future Ameriabank will have the opportunity to significantly increase its size. As the person responsible for the management of the bank's assets and liabilities, I must say that the management of assets of 1 billion US dollars in such a small market as ours requires the existence of quite complex systems. In such a case, the manual control option does not work. Our bank's assets make up 10% of Armenia's GDP. And as a system forming bank, we feel our responsibility, the need to be predictable and stable. Today, the risks of Ameriabank are, in a certain sense, the risks of the entire banking system. For example, our actions to manage the Bank's liquidity affect the entire banking system. Therefore, we are stricter and more conservative in terms of liquidity and market risk management. We are not limited to one source of funding, be it a deposit or raising funds from foreign markets. We pay great attention to the diversification of funding sources. The main sources are funds raised from customers, international financial organizations through trade financing instruments, various credit programs and debt securities. We recently successfully issued dollar bonds in the domestic market. The volume of the issue was 15 million USD, and the coupon yield was 6.75%.\nYour customers are very lucky. Such an interest rate is rare in the market today.\nYes, the maximum interest rate for dollar deposits (1-2 years) is 5.5%. But let me tell you where the 6.75% interest rate came from. The point is that the policy change by the Central Bank in the sphere of mandatory reserves favors the issuance of long-term bonds. in this case, issuing bonds requires lower provisioning costs than deposits, which is why the bank can offer such high interest rates without increasing its total borrowing costs. In addition, from the point of view of liquidity management, issued bonds are considered a more stable resource base than time deposits. Strange as it may seem, bonds are also more liquid for the client, as they can be sold on the secondary market, often without significant interest loss. We encourage the Central Bank's policy to promote bond issuance and believe that it will become an impetus for the development of the capital market.\nIt's no secret that the Armenian market is small, and the growth of banks at the expense of the domestic market is limited. At the same time there is a huge foreign market. Do Armenian banks have the opportunity to enter foreign markets, and in what directions can this be done?\nToday, Armenian banks have a sufficient base of non-resident physical and legal entity clients. Most of these clients are related to the Armenian Diaspora. Some of them are commercial organizations (mainly Russian) that are served by Armenian banks. In general, the fact that Armenia is perceived as a \"peaceful haven\" is a positive sign.\nAre high interest rates the reason our financial market is so attractive?\nNo, not only. Although interest rates in Armenia are definitely competitive, the main factor is that the risks in Russian banks are of greater concern to customers, and many prefer to keep their funds in Armenian banks. When it comes to lending, we have many regulatory restrictions and complexities associated with credit risk assessment in other countries. That is why Armenian banks rarely carry out such activities. \nWe are definitely interested in the idea of expanding into foreign markets. However, despite these ambitions, we will be happy if the Armenian economy grows rapidly, financial flows increase, investments are made, the country's GDP increases, and banks can play a greater role in serving our economy. After all, the main mission of Armenian banks is lending to the Armenian economy.",

Today, our interlocutor is Gevorg Manukyan, head of the service of \"Ameriabank\" CJSC Individual and premium client managers.\nIn which situation is it worth considering refinancing a mortgage loan?\n- If you took a loan with less favorable terms, and the monthly repayments take up a significant part of your budget, refinancing a loan at Ameriabank is a good opportunity to improve the loan conditions. We can extend the term of the loan by reducing the monthly repayments accordingly. We also offer quite interesting interest rates. As a result of refinancing, the interest rate of the loan also decreases very often. For example, if you took out a mortgage two years ago with an annual interest rate of 16%, made regular repayments, but you still have to repay the loan in a few more years, and now you find out that the mortgage loan interest rate in Ameriabank is 11%, it is the right time to contact Ameriabank. and refinance the loan.\nToo often, the thought of going through the loan application process again is enough to deter a borrower from refinancing a loan. How about this?\nIt is necessary to go through all the defined processes. It is a requirement of the law that cannot be circumvented. But I assure you that our offer is so profitable from a financial point of view that it is worth spending time and refinancing the loan. Many clients turn to us not because they want to extend the term of the loan and thereby reduce the amount of repayments, but because of the attractive interest rates. Obviously, 11% is more profitable than 16%. And the terms, on the contrary, are sometimes requested to be shortened in order to be able to repay the obligations to the bank faster. In this case, the amount of monthly repayments is reduced at the expense of lowering the interest rate.\nIs it true that when refinancing mortgage loans, Ameriabank also takes over the costs related to the formulation of the loan?\nYes, the offer applies to all types of refinanced loans under the campaign until August 1, 2016: business loans, mortgages, consumer loans secured by real estate and automobiles, non-revolving credit lines and overdrafts. The borrower is exempt from loan origination and service fees. Notary and cadastral fees, as well as property valuation fees, are paid by Ameriabank.\nMr. Manukyan, Ameriabank offers a wide range of mortgage loans. Does the refinancing offer apply to all types of loans listed or is it just residential real estate?\nOur refinancing offer applies to the entire range of mortgage loans: apartment, residential house purchase loan, residential house construction/renovation loan, commercial real estate purchase loan. By the way, the loan for the purchase of commercial real estate is one of our products in great demand. Very often, customers with a stable income, wanting to create an alternative source of income, purchase commercial premises with the intention of later renting them out. The loan for the purchase of commercial real estate can be granted for a period of up to 15 years. We are also ready to consider the possibility of combining mortgage loans taken by the client in different banks. I would also like to note that we not only refinance loans, but we are also happy to provide new loans.\nI will say more, our new clients who transfer their loan to Ameriabank will benefit from new alternative service approaches in addition to profitable loan offers. For example, our \"Youth\" and \"Arshakunyats\" branches work every day, without days off (except for 2-3 non-working days in a year) with an extended working schedule from 10:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Such a service schedule is very convenient for people working from 9:00 to 18:00. In addition, the mentioned branches are located in commercial centers, so it is possible to combine shopping and the process of using banking services. Perhaps you have already noticed our new express banking terminals installed in the city, through which it is possible to perform various operations, in particular, to pay off the loan through cash entry terminals, without wasting time visiting the bank. I should mention that Ameriabank is very actively developing remote banking services, which are one of the most important directions for us today. And our new clients can use the entire range of remote banking services at any time, including: mobile banking, TV banking, online banking, phone banking.\n \n \nThanks for the interview. I think your customer count will definitely increase by one today, and it will be me.\nSource: tert.am",

        "title": "Everything You Want to Know About Loan Refinancing (Part 3)",
        "content": "We identify the features of consumer loans\nIn the previous days, we talked about how the idea of Bizo and Hypo came about, about the advantages offered by Ameriabank's loan refinancing offer to entrepreneurs operating in the small and medium business sector. Today, Avetik Avetisyan, manager of the \"Youth\" branch of \"Ameriabank\" CJSC, will tell how we pay too much where it is possible to save money, and what should be done by those whose only concern today is not to confuse the days of loan repayments.\nMr. Avetisyan, many have existing consumer loans that they took before. Since then, everything has changed, both our incomes and the terms of granting new loans have changed. Isn't it time to think about loan refinancing?\nConsumer loans, perhaps, take the first place in terms of demand. The peculiarity of consumer loans lies in their variety. Maybe it is because of this diversity that people take different loans from different banks and spend a lot of money for their service.\nAnd get tangled up in loans...\nThe phrase \"credit crunched\" seems to be about consumer credit. Because here there is one more feature. we often take out consumer loans on a rush basis. When it comes to a small amount, the borrower asks only one question: how much should I pay per month, and if the presented amount satisfies him, he takes the loan without paying attention to the interest rate, term, commissions, etc. Moreover, since the amount of the consumer loan, as a rule, is not large, any additional costs significantly increase the actual interest rate. For example, the declared 18% per month along with the loan service fee can actually become 20-25%. A few such \"small\" loans are enough for the monthly repayments to significantly affect the family budget. Then maybe the client realizes that he did something wrong, but it's already too late, and some don't even think about it, unless the amount of payments becomes critical. But if you can allocate only 5% of your income to repay the loan, why pay 10%, especially since today every dram saved is important?\nWill refinancing the loan make it possible to correct this mistake?\nYes, what we are offering our potential customers today is very beneficial from all angles. I will say once again what my colleagues have said. In case of refinancing the loan at Ameriabank, the Bank pays all the costs of collateral evaluation (if any), notary certification and cadastral fees. The customer is also exempt from loan origination and service fees. Our interest rates are very competitive: 14% in USD, 17% in AMD and 12% in EUR. The loan can be granted for up to 7 years. Our offer covers consumer loans secured by real estate or car, non-revolving credit lines and overdrafts.\nOur offer allows people with several loans in different banks, with different interest rates and terms, to save their money, time and nerves. At the same time, I consider it necessary to mention that we refinance only those loans that have at least one year of proper service history.\nBy extending the term of the loan, we reduce the borrower's monthly repayments. If the client took out the loan at a higher interest rate, the amount of repayments also decreases due to the reduction of the interest rate. So, instead of repaying loans at five different banks, the borrower makes one monthly repayment at one bank, which is much more convenient, you must agree. As a result of loan refinancing, free funds are created, and they can be spent on other purposes that were previously unavailable due to lack of sufficient funds.\nThank you for the clarification, Mr. Avetisyan.\n \nTomorrow we will present the last part of our conversation about refinancing loans, which is about mortgages. You'll learn why it's worth going through the mortgage application process again. Follow us!\nSource: tert.am",

        "content": "\"Everything you would like to know about loan refinancing\" (part 1) The conversation with Andranik Khachatryan, head of the management department of regional units of \"Ameriabank\" CJSC, and project manager Ofelia Martirosyan, here.\nHow to save money and grow the business?\nWe continue to talk about loan refinancing, and today Vahram Gevorgyan, manager of Ameriabank CJSC \"Sayat-Nova\" branch, will talk about the opportunities Ameriabank's offer creates for small and medium-sized businesses.\nSmall and medium-sized businesses have always been our \"weak link\", and in the current crisis situation, the situation of small and medium-sized businesses has worsened, especially if there are outstanding financial obligations. What can you offer entrepreneurs?\nI would describe small and medium business as the most sensitive link, which is immediately affected by all changes in the economy and financial situation. That is why access to finance and the use of non-standard decisions are very important for small and medium-sized businesses. I agree with you that the situation of small and medium businesses has worsened in the difficult economic conditions. At the same time, the demand of small and medium-sized businesses for credit products is maintained, and this is not a consequence of the crisis, but a feature of the given sector. Small and medium-sized businesses always have growth potential, and there are relatively short-term business requirements, so there is always a need for banking and especially credit products. Here it is important to use banking products correctly. We are always ready to help clients make an appropriate decision, orient themselves on the type and timing of the product, and if necessary, develop non-standard solutions appropriate to the client's business.\nAs part of the campaign carried out by Ameriabank, you offer entrepreneurs such a credit product as business loan refinancing. Is your offer so profitable that it makes sense for the client to go through the entire process of formulating a loan again and spend time on it?\nDefinitely yes. Let me explain what this product is. Business loan refinancing enables customers with loans in other banks to transfer their loans to Ameriabank on the most favorable terms. At the same time, the Bank carries out the cost of valuation of the pledged property, notary certification and cadastral payments. The customer is also exempt from loan origination and service fees. During the study of the loan application, the Bank examines the features of the client's business, the problems faced by the business and then offers optimal solutions, which are not related to the convenience of repayment of the loan (although this issue is also being resolved), but to the very situation related to business development. So time is spent gathering information, understanding current and anticipated business issues, assessing customer creditworthiness, and more. We focus on the baseline metrics that are critical to sustaining and growing a business. In the case of lending, these are terms, interest rates, and the right product. And during loan refinancing, Ameriabank revises the terms in favor of the client.\nThe deadlines for making decisions on applications by banks usually raise doubts among customers...\nI assure you that all processes at Ameriabank are organized as quickly as possible, hassles related to paperwork are excluded, and if the client provides the necessary information, he receives an answer within the specified time.\nI would also like to draw your attention to the fact that it makes sense to refinance the loan not only in case of difficulties with repayments. If the borrower is servicing the loan in another bank without any problems, but there is an option to use own resources more efficiently, why not use it? This scheme is widely used in foreign markets, where borrowers use the full potential of the loan. It is especially necessary to take into account that small and medium business is the field where any resource, be it time or financial, refers to business development. Our proposal enables the entrepreneur to spend less funds for loan repayment and direct the freed funds to the further development of the business.\nDoes your offer provide for a flexible repayment schedule? Is it possible to combine several loans into one to simplify the repayment process?\nWe always carefully study the specifics of our clients' businesses. I can say that the diversity of companies, even those companies that operate in the same sector of the economy, is one of the main characteristics of small and medium-sized businesses. If necessary, we offer clients a flexible repayment schedule depending on the seasonality of financial flows. It is clear, of course, that if we are talking about a summer cafe, then the main financial flows are received in the summer months, therefore, it is more correct to distribute the credit load in such a way that most of the loan is repaid in that period. Very often, it is the Bank itself that offers a flexible repayment schedule, and not the borrower, because many entrepreneurs in the small and medium business sector do not even imagine that such a possibility exists. As for the consolidation of loans, there is no obstacle for this at Ameriabank. But before making a decision, of course, it is necessary to study the terms and purposes of loans in order to understand the advisability of combining several loans into one.\nOther Armenian banks also offer loan refinancing. What is the main advantage of refinancing a loan at Ameriabank?\nFirst of all, our refinancing offer is a very competitive product in terms of loan term, repayment schedule and interest rates. In addition, I would advise all customers to carefully study all the conditions, regardless of whether they are applying for loan refinancing or just to get a new loan, not to be tempted only by the advertised interest rate, to check, for example, the amount of the loan service fee, which can significantly increase the actual interest rate : As I already mentioned, we take care of almost all the costs associated with transferring the customer's loan to our bank. Thus, in our case, the declared interest rate hardly differs from the actual interest rate. Perhaps our main advantage, regardless of the campaigns carried out, is always the focus on the customer and the satisfaction of customer needs through package solutions. \nBoth in the case of loan refinancing and new loans, we always develop the most beneficial option for the client, which can combine in one package banking products that are used at different stages of solving business problems. In other words, a \"credit basket\" is formed, which can include such products as a loan, credit line, letter of credit, factoring, bank guarantee, purchase order financing, etc. Naturally, we have standard conditions according to which we provide financial resources, but within the framework of these standards, we build a loan or a package of offers every time, effectively creating a new product and a new solution for each borrower. When the client sees that our priority is not to get the maximum profit right away, but to create conditions for the growth of the client's business, that is when a mutually beneficial partnership is created.\nThank you Mr. Gevorgyan. I think entrepreneurs will appreciate Ameriabank's offer.\n \nTomorrow we will talk about an equally interesting topic. We will talk about how to save money, time and nerves, we will tell about the refinancing of consumer loans.\nSource: tert.am",

        "title": "Everything you'll ever want to know about loan refinancing",
        "content": "Refinancing a loan is a great way to overcome financial difficulties or simply reduce costs, that is, to take the same loan under the most favorable conditions. With refinancing, you can get a loan with a larger amount, a longer term, a lower interest rate, reduce the amount of monthly repayments, combine several loans into one, etc. There are not many loan refinancing offers in the market, but they do exist. Ameriabank is running a loan refinancing campaign for borrowers who want to effectively manage their financial resources and time. We have found out from Ameriabank employees everything you would like to know about loan refinancing, and we will present everything to you in order. Today, the interlocutors of our reporter are Andranik Khachatryan, Head of the Department of Management of Territorial Divisions of \"Ameriabank\" CJSC, and Project Manager Ofelia Martirosyan.\nMr. Khachatryan, there is a difficult situation in the lending market. The issue of credit obligations of enterprises and individuals to financial institutions is constantly discussed among the public. How do you assess the current situation?\nA difficult situation has arisen in Armenia, as well as in the entire post-Soviet area. Forecasts of a rapid economic recovery did not materialize, and we failed to reach pre-crisis indicators of GDP growth and economic activity. Moreover, in 2008-2009 Expectations to quickly overcome the crisis led to the fact that many entrepreneurs accumulated loans, but the situation of borrowers worsened sharply due to the decrease in economic growth rates and the decline in consumer demand. In some companies, the profit was reduced by 20-30%, and if we add to it dram devaluation and inflation by 15-20%, then it becomes clear that repayment of loans, especially in dollars, becomes problematic. I would like to note that unjustified optimistic expectations in a certain sense contribute to the growth of problem loans. Many people are constantly waiting for good times to come and the problem will be solved. However, in our opinion, those who can make decisions in any situation are successful. A new reality has been created, which may not be very favorable, but it is stable, and I think everyone has already come to terms with that new reality. We are used to difficulties and understand that even in a new environment you can be active, continue to grow and develop.\nIn the new situation, entrepreneurs have become more cautious, they do not take risks to start new projects and expand existing businesses.\nNot only do they not take the risk to invest in the business, but too often having credit obligations, they are unable to service the additional credit burden and develop the business. We constantly monitor the identification of customer needs. And we know very well that customers' financial flows have changed, we understand that they need the bank's support and need new banking products with long-term and more competitive interest rates. Considering the current situation, as well as wanting to support the growth of economic activity, Ameriabank offered borrowers from other banks to refinance their loan in Ameriabank, giving them the opportunity to extend the loan period. This offer is valid until August 1, 2016 and applies to business loans, mortgages, consumer loans secured by real estate or car, non-revolving credit lines and overdrafts.\n \nAs a result of refinancing, the amount of monthly repayments of the loan decreases, and free resources appear, which can be directed to solving other problems. I would like to note that last year was very successful for us in terms of cooperation with international financial organizations. We almost doubled the bank's capital, thanks to which Ameriabank can now offer the best conditions to borrowers. Let me say right away that this offer is not aimed at customers who have problems with loan repayment. If the borrower's income is constantly decreasing and he is unable to service the loan, then other ways should be sought to solve this problem. We want to attract people who need new approaches to loans and their repayment, people whose income may have decreased, but remains stable. We are ready to offer those customers terms in which loan repayments correspond to their incomes, so the offer applies to loans with a service history of at least one year. Of course, during the continuation of this conversation, my colleagues will tell in more detail about the loan refinancing offer offered by Ameriabank. And I should mention that the product is aimed at people who want to combine loans, make a more convenient repayment schedule, reduce the amount of monthly repayments, that is, make loan servicing more convenient and efficient. I should also mention that refinancing can be combined with an increase in the amount of the loan, if there is such a need.\nThe next question is addressed to Ofelia Martirosyan.\nI saw your ad for refinancing loans, Hypo and Bizo. In fact, Ameriabank also showed a creative approach in this area.\nThe characters of the advertising campaign were created after a long period of thought and discussion. We decided to take the risk. Let's imagine a family with a stable monthly income and a loan that requires 30% of the family's monthly income to be paid off. In the situation created as a result of currency devaluation, reduction of family income and inflation, a significant part of the family budget is spent on loan servicing, and there is a feeling that a new member of the family has appeared, for which quite a lot of money is spent. The picture is the same for small and medium-sized businesses, it seems that a new employee appears, to which a part of the budget needs to be allocated, despite the reduction of other expenses of the company. Thus was born the idea of expressing credit as a figure that consumes family and business funds. And we chose to create a light, cheerful and mischievous image that would evoke positive emotions and help convey to the public the main idea of our campaign: Ameriabank's offer eases the borrower's credit burden.\n \nFor an industry as serious as banking, creating such an image is a bold move.\nYes, the style in which the commercials of this campaign were created is very different from the image created by Ameriabank. We were even prepared to face criticism. But to our surprise and delight, the idea was loved by both our employees and the general public. And the names Hypo and Bizo (abbreviated versions of the words \"mortgage\" and \"business loan\"), as they say, were accepted by the people. And most importantly, after starting the advertising campaign, the sales volume exceeded all our expectations. And this means that we were able to successfully solve our problem - to show people that in fact a targeted and properly structured loan serves growth and development, helps to take advantage of the opportunities provided by life.\nThanks for the interesting information.\n \n \nAnd tomorrow our conversation will be on a very popular topic: what small and medium businesses will benefit from within the refinancing of loans offered by Ameriabank.\nSource: tert.am",

        "content": "What problems concern Armenian bankers, what should borrowers do, for whom it is increasingly difficult to properly service loans, what is the advantage of a high reputation - the CEO of \"Ameriabank\" CJSC spoke about all this in his interview with news.am. deputy, financial director Gevorg Tarumyan.\nMr. Tarumyan, the statistics of the first three months of this year are moderately negative regarding the banking system. What factors do you think will have the biggest impact on the banking system in 2016?\n2015 GDP growth (3%) was higher than forecast, but that's where the good news ends. 2015 It was a very difficult year for the banking system. The reduction of private remittances by more than a third (35%) led to a sharp decline in investment, domestic trade, and thus imports, and zero growth in some sectors of the economy (such as construction). This, in turn, caused a decrease in lending volumes and a deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio. 2016 in the first quarter, the decline in the volume of private remittances practically stopped, and today the main indicators of economic activity are positive or zero, but not negative. In these conditions, despite the low rates of lending growth, it is pleasing that the volume of lending is not decreasing, but increasing. Two indicators of the banking system are cause for concern: the volume of non-performing loans, which is almost 11%, and the profitability of banks, which is approaching zero. The impact of various external and internal factors indicates that in the current year the banking system will continue to work in conditions of low economic activity and relatively low demand for banking services. The latter is also caused by the reduction of the population.\nCan you identify the main positive and the main negative factors?\nThe main negative impact comes from Russia, where economic decline continues amid low oil prices. Let's hope that in the second half of the year we will witness, if not the recovery of economic growth in Russia, then at least a significant slowing down of the rate of decline. The other negative factor is more long-term and is related to the slow process of reforms in Armenia's business environment.\nThe sharp economic growth expected in Iran due to the lifting of sanctions can have a significant positive impact on Armenia's economy. There are also positive expectations regarding the 2014-2015 by the CBA of RA. with the consistent easing of the unprecedentedly tight monetary policy implemented. We expect new transactions of mergers and acquisitions in the banking system, as a result of which the enlarged banks will become more reliable and efficient. The effectiveness of investments in banks is measured by return on equity. Let me say that in 2016 according to the results of the first quarter, this indicator was only 2.2% in the RA banking system. This is a very low indicator and banks should make efforts to improve the situation.\n \n2015 The most painful problem for banks was loan repayment? What is the situation in 2016?\nTraditionally, the quality of the credit portfolio in Armenia has been at a high level. Until 2008-2009 the weight of non-performing loans did not exceed 4-5%. However, after the global economic crisis, this figure reached 8.4% in 2014, and in 2015, it exceeded 10% for the first time. In Ameriabank, this indicator was lower, and during this year, the share of non-performing loans in the loan portfolio has already decreased by 2 percentage points, making 5.35%. Unfortunately, the overall index of the banking system does not show significant change and remains high at around 11%. The good news is that today's non-performing loans in banks are a legacy of past years, and fortunately, there is no increase in non-performing loans among new ones. According to our estimates, the weight of non-performing loans has already reached its maximum and in 2016 this figure will decrease.\nAnd if we evaluate the situation from the borrower's point of view? For many, the credit burden is beyond their means. And it's not always the borrower's fault.\nEven two years ago, borrowers were working under different conditions. Sales volumes were significantly higher and the US dollar exchange rate was 15-20% lower. Due to the high demand and the favorable exchange rate of the ruble, the volume of exports to Russia was increasing. However, external economic shocks and the devaluation of the dram had a negative impact on the borrowers' financial condition, thus weakening their ability to service the loans. You know that more than 75% of the loan portfolio of the RA banking system are dollar loans (because the banks' liabilities are mostly in dollars). In the case of business loans, everything is much more complicated, because here the level of dollarization is higher, and monetary inflows are highly dependent on weak domestic consumption and exports (which, as a rule, depend on the Russian market). If the client's business is stable, but as a result of external shocks, a drop in domestic demand and fluctuations in exchange rates, cash inflows have temporarily decreased, we offer to use our bank's package, which is valid until 2016. August 1. The idea of the offer is that the borrowers of other banks, who have properly serviced their loan during the previous year, can refinance it in Ameriabank with more favorable terms, which will allow to lighten the credit burden. \nAs a result of refinancing, the terms of the loan are revised: the term, interest rate, repayment schedule, so that the amount of monthly payments made by the borrower is reduced in accordance with his cash income. The promotion applies to both small and medium-sized businesses, as well as mortgage loans and all types of consumer loans.\nTurning to the businesses you fund, what is the situation there? How important is the bank's understanding of the client's business for successful cooperation?\nI think gone are the days when banks were less interested in the success of the client's business, when collateral was the main prerequisite for lending, when the client's business was not transparent, and efficiency was secondary. Fortunately, Ameriabank chose the strategy of close cooperation with the client from the beginning. Today, our customers include well-established companies with whom we have come a long way. Our bank employs people specialized in various fields of the economy, and with their help the bank evaluates credit risks, and the client gets the opportunity to make his business more efficient. In addition, we try to understand the financial and production risks of clients, to understand their dependence on exchange rate fluctuations and external shocks. To mitigate these risks, we impose certain contractual restrictions on customers that protect their business from failure.\nHow would you describe the bank's liability base?\nWe can say that we have an ideal commitment structure. They are well-diversified by sources: funds raised from customers (time and demand), loans from international financial institutions and other large borrowings (funds raised from foreign banks, subordinated debt, bond issues, trade finance instruments), and each has an almost equal share of the bank. in the liability structure. As you know, Ameriabank is the leader in the RA banking system both in terms of total liabilities and funds raised from clients. Moreover, we are recording continuous growth in term deposits of individuals, although there are more attractive offers in the market in terms of interest rates. In our opinion, customers are becoming more and more financially literate, and for them, the quality of service, high liquidity and the level of capital adequacy and, therefore, reliability of the bank are becoming more important than extremely high interest rates. We are making great efforts to significantly reduce interest rates on borrowing from international financial institutions. And the result of those efforts is obvious. today, Ameriabank attracts funds from international financial markets at lower interest rates than most banks in Armenia and the region. The reputation of our bank also plays a big role.\nSpeaking of reputation, I know that a number of events took place in May that confirmed Ameriabank's high reputation among international financial institutions.\nYes, you are right. The first half of May was a period of good news for us. International rating agency Fitch reaffirmed the long-term foreign currency issuer's B+ rating, changing the outlook to stable from negative a year ago. The fact that the forecast was set to \"stable\" means that, according to the agency's estimates, Ameriabank will maintain its position despite the pressure from the external environment. We also signed a USD 20 million loan agreement with the German Development and Investment Company (DEG) to finance small and medium-sized businesses. Another nice event, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development awarded Ameriabank with the \"Deal of the Year Energy Efficiency Award\" for contributing to increasing the energy efficiency of the greenhouse infrastructure in Armenia.\nMr. Tarumyan, many people today do not make long-term plans, they prefer conservative development models, which are specific to markets experiencing decline or stagnation: to maintain the current level of business, to wait until the crisis passes. You chose a different strategy: the aggressive growth strategy. Was the choice conscious?\nPreviously, when the annual growth of the banking system was 15-20%, everyone had the opportunity to grow. Today, when Armenia's economy is oversaturated with loans, the number of new business projects is limited, and the competition between banks has intensified, few are able to ensure portfolio growth. Bank margins are also shrinking. Inefficient banks become unprofitable, and the question arises as to why and at what expense they can provide growth. From the beginning, our bank adopted a different policy aimed at long-term development rather than short-term profit. At the end of last year, Ameriabank signed two unprecedented deals for Armenia with international financial institutions, as a result of which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development invested 40 million USD to acquire a package of shares of Ameriabank, and the International Finance Corporation provided a long-term subordinated loan of 50 million USD. Thanks to these transactions, our capabilities in the field of lending will significantly exceed the capabilities of the market in the next 3 years. The almost double increase in capital allows us to finance such large projects that no Armenian bank was able to finance alone before. During the year, we increased our market share by 2 percentage points to 15%. And despite the temporary slowdown in economic activity and economic-geographical risks, we are optimistic about the future and are making long-term plans. We believe that institutional structures like banks should not react rigidly to economic cycles, which are inevitable, but should be a stable partner for business. Let me say more: today, within the framework of Ameriabank's credit campaigns, we not only refinance the loans provided by other banks, but also allocate a sufficient volume of additional credit funds to the borrowers of other banks, because our capital, our financial resources allow this, unlike many other banks that today unable to finance their clients due to lack of capital and credit resources. So the current results prove that we are moving in the right direction and our chosen model is justified.",

        "title": "Ameriabank's new achievements. Raising up to $20 million in financing from Fitch's B+ rating with a stable outlook",
        "content": "\"Ameriabank\" CJSC and DEG (Deutsche Investitions-und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH) signed a $20 million loan agreement with a 6-year repayment period in London on May 12. The loan will be directed to the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Republic of Armenia.\nThe contract was signed by Artak Hanesyan, CEO of Ameriabank, Director of Financial Institutions of DEG Europe and Asia Rena Terfract and Senior Investment Manager of Financial Institutions of Europe and Asia Julian Locke. \nDEG is a member of KfW Bankengruppe (KfW Banking Group). It finances investments by private companies in developing and transition countries. As one of Europe's largest development finance organizations, DEG encourages investment by private business entities in sustainable economic growth and improved living standards.\n\"As you can see, Armenia is still attractive for foreign partners and investors. The main goal of this partnership is the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, which remains one of our most important, strategic directions. We are working to increase the volume of investments,\" Ameriabank's financial director Gevorg Tarumyan said at the meeting with journalists. \nAmeriabank-DEG cooperation started back in 2009, when a credit line agreement was signed with this organization and the Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO). Later, the competition turned into a strategic partnership, when in 2012 A loan agreement of 20 million US dollars was signed in November. This cooperation is in line with the Bank's strategy, according to which the financing of small and medium-sized businesses is one of the primary directions of the Bank's credit policy.\nTarumyan, listing the recent achievements and successes of Ameriabank, also spoke about the \"Deal of the Year - Energy Efficiency\" award, which was awarded to the bank by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 2015 for improving the energy efficiency of the greenhouse infrastructure in Armenia. \nAmeriabank has issued two letters of credit for \"Alternative Energy\" LLC, which were approved and financed by Komertsbank under the guarantee of EBRD. \nTarumyan informed that the Development Bank of the Netherlands (FMO) also participated in the transaction, covering a certain part of the political and payment risks. The total cost of the project was $2.3 million, of which $1.91 million was financed through letters of credit issued by Ameriabank. \nThe director of finance noted that thanks to the received financing, the company \"Alternative Energy\" purchased high-quality energy-saving equipment from the Czech Republic, which provides an opportunity to save $390,000 in energy per year compared to greenhouse companies using conventional equipment, as well as to reduce the use of natural gas by 1,950,000 in the amount of m³. \nAccording to him, thanks to the use of modern high-quality equipment, the company gets the opportunity to gain competitive advantages both in local and foreign markets.\n \nAnswering PanARMENIAN.Net's question whether loans for greenhouse farms are provided on preferential terms, Tarumyan emphasized that the crediting of greenhouse farms proceeds in 2 stages. \n\"At the first stage, we issue a letter of credit, which is on much more favorable terms than a loan. In the second stage is the loan, the terms of which depend on creditworthiness, terms, etc., but we try to provide relatively affordable terms. If we compare, the loans we provide are very competitive in terms of terms and interest rates,\" explained the financial director. \nHe also emphasized that greenhouse farms are also a strategic direction, the programs with the involvement of the bank provide an opportunity to make agriculture independent of weather conditions. \n\"In addition, we have financed large economies so that they can export outside of Armenia,\" Tarumyan noted.\nEmphasizing the role of greenhouse farms for the development of Armenia's agriculture, Ameriabank actively supports the financing of greenhouse farms, particularly for the import of equipment that ensures energy efficiency and high productivity. More than 70% of greenhouse projects in Armenia are financed by Ameriabank. \nThanks to the use of energy-saving and the latest technological equipment, greenhouse farms have the opportunity to gain competitive advantages, ensure uninterrupted production throughout the year and make a significant contribution to the development of Armenia's economy. \nAnother success of Ameriabank is that Ameriabank has been given a \"B plus\" rating with a stable outlook by the Fitch rating agency. Thus, the prestigious international rating organization reaffirmed the \"B plus\" rating of the issuer of long-term obligations in foreign currency awarded to Ameriabank, setting a stable outlook instead of the negative outlook (Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR)) granted a year ago. \nReaffirmation of such a rating speaks of the Bank's acceptable financial indicators, significant liquidity reserves, manageable refinancing risks and high reputation. Fitch highlighted the fact that, despite the high competition in the RA banking system, Ameriabank has taken a firm position in the market, maintaining its leading position in the lending sector (market share: 14.8%), trade financing, obligations to customers (market share: 15%).\nTarumyan noted that by reviewing the rating outlook, Fitch expects that Ameriabank will maintain its stable position, resisting the pressures of the difficult external environment. According to him, this will enable the bank to strengthen its stable positions. \nIn addition, the bank also has a sufficient level of profitability and a significant capital reserve due to the $30 million funds raised from the EBRD in December 2015. \nObtaining a \"B plus\" rating with a stable outlook by Fitch will contribute to increasing the recognition of Ameriabank in the international arena and the level of trust in the Bank, and the expansion of partnership relations with foreign investors in Armenia.\nSource: PanARMENIAN.Net",

A few years ago, shareholders preferred to turn to foreign companies to manage large projects, but now, as a rule, they prefer local companies. \nIf we try to characterize the market of investment banking services from a price point of view, the competition between the main market participants is mainly unfolding in the high price segment. Our competitors are the Armenian subsidiaries of the \"Big Four\". The \"Big Four\" are the four largest auditing and consulting services companies in the world. However, the number of transactions concluded by Ameriabank and the Ameria group of companies, the volume of investment banking services and consulting services provided to clients exceeds the volume of services provided by all our competitors, and all of them combined. There is no special competition in the mid-price segment, the main players here are the \"Big Ten\" international audit firms. Unfortunately, the economy segment of investment banking services in Armenia is not yet developed, the demand for these services among small and medium enterprises is low and sporadic. I must mention that the premium segment of the market is in the stage of stagnation, which has its own objective reasons. The premium segment was mainly associated with privatization tenders and state infrastructure projects. Famous global investment banks, which provided advisory services to the Armenian government, mainly worked in this segment. Fees for services provided by such consulting firms are quite high, so the value of the projects should exceed 100 million USD. Since almost all large assets in Armenia have already been privatized, this segment, as I already mentioned, is at a stage of stagnation, if we do not take into account the organization of two issues of sovereign Eurobonds by the syndicate of global underwriters. \nIn terms of product range, we feel quite comfortable in the market. For example, according to the international CBonds financial information agency, Ameriabank's share in the market of debt securities (bonds) underwriting services exceeds 40%. In total, we have placed more customer securities than all other underwriting banks combined. In 2015, we organized the placement of three issues of dram bonds of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), provided a secondary liquid market on the NASDAQ OMX Armenia trading platform for the bonds of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), EBRD and local corporate issuers. : Our plans for this year are also quite ambitious. Most likely, Ameriabank will issue its own bonds for the first time. We are also negotiating with potential issuers on the issue of regular bond issues.\nIn 2015, we raised USD 120 million in long-term financing for our corporate clients. Funding for another 50 million US dollars is in progress. 2015 was quite a successful year for agribusiness in terms of the emergence of new opportunities in the markets of the Eurasian Economic Union (primarily Russia), as well as the growth of demand for fruits and vegetables. Already from the beginning of the year, local manufacturers began to experience a severe lack of long-term capital for increasing production capacity. And we help them solve these problems. \n2015 was also significant from the point of view of M&A transactions (purchase of companies, involvement of a strategic shareholder in the capital). We have participated in almost all major deals concluded in Armenia last year with consulting services. We are mainly talking about transactions in the mining, energy and telecommunications sectors. \nBusiness valuation services (equity/business/equity valuation reports) are also in high demand in the market. Foreign investors, international financial institutions, diaspora investors and corporate clients of the local market have been using our services for assessing the fair market value of a business for many years. Our valuation reports stand up to rigorous validity checks by experts, international investment banks and consultants, and clients, receiving our asset valuation report, calmly negotiate and successfully complete business (equity) purchase and sale transactions. \nSummarizing all this, I would like to note that Ameriabank's leadership in the market of investment banking services was highlighted by Global Finance magazine, which recently published a list of the best investment banks in the world.\nWhat are the characteristics of the competitive environment in the specified market segment?\nWhen choosing a consultant, always and everywhere, the main and decisive criterion is the quality of the services provided. In this regard, Armenia is no exception, and when making a choice, our clients prefer well-developed project management processes and technologies, a high level of confidentiality, as well as companies with high reliability and reputation. Financial potential of the consultant is no less important factor for successful activity. From this point of view, Ameriabank occupies a special position in our market, because it is a symbiosis of the largest commercial bank and investment banking in Armenia. We have the financial base that is sometimes so necessary to successfully complete the purchase or sale of companies, the issuance of securities or other transactions. All other consultants operating in the Armenian market have limited or mediated access to financial resources. Our clients have the opportunity to receive all related services (financial, tax and commercial compliance verification, legal expertise, contract drafting, transaction financing) in one package on a \"one-stop\" basis. In addition, our company's connections with companies operating in the real sector, as well as understanding the needs of corporate clients, are among Ameriabank's competitive advantages. \nI would like to note that the market of investment banking services is quite developed and dynamic, but not everyone knows about it. Unfortunately, investment banking as a segment of the financial market remains out of the mainstream media's attention. The participants, details and motives of the major transactions carried out in Armenia are not adequately covered. But quite interesting processes are taking place here.\nMr. Mosikyan, how do you assess the opportunities of Armenian companies to enter the securities market? How interested are foreign investors in bonds of Armenian companies?\nI see no obstacles to entering the local bond market. It is important to have the willingness and to offer investors an acceptable limit of credit risk. As far as the Eurobond market is concerned, the desire of the issuer and the willingness to pay for the underwriter's services are not enough. First of all, it should be about issuing a bond of at least 75 million US dollars, and more preferably 150 million US dollars. As we can see, this is a serious obstacle for local companies, and it turns out that only large companies can become potential issuers. Moreover, they must have a credit rating and quality credit history determined by international credit rating agencies (preferably two agencies). \nWorking with foreign investors implies a completely different level of transparency of financial statements, quality of corporate management and professionalism of management personnel. And all this implies quite high costs for the services of a respectable audit firm and credit rating agencies.\nWhat growth opportunities does EBRD's stake in Ameriabank's capital offer?\nIt is obvious that the cooperation of EBRD and Ameriabank has a synergistic effect on various directions of our activities. As you know, EBRD implements many direct investment projects in Armenia, Georgia and CIS countries. Ameriabank, in turn, has access to a wide range of potential investors interested in direct investment in the mentioned regions, as well as resources for co-financing company acquisition transactions (LBO/MBO). Therefore, a successful transaction with one party will mean a successful and profitable exit from the project for the other partner. I must mention that the knowledge, databases and professional connections in corporate finance and investment banking services were available to us even before the deal with EBRD. Ameriabank's Board of Directors includes experienced financiers, investment bankers, venture fund and international financial asset managers. Following the closing of the transaction with the EBRD, we will be joined by a new independent director who represents the EBRD and has extensive experience in the provision of financial, commercial and investment banking services. Therefore, our team will be supplemented by another high-quality specialist, who will support the promotion of our services and their quality improvement with his experience and knowledge.\nSource: armenpress.am",

        "title": "2016 will be a turning point for the Armenian banking system",
        "content": "In a conversation with the correspondent of ArmInfo news agency, Artak Hanesyan, Chairman of Ameriabank Directorate - General Director, presents his views on the new image and prospects of the banking system of Armenia.\nIn 2016, the crisis phenomena that began to appear in the middle of 2014 and deepened in 2015 will be more significant for Armenia. The situation worsened at the border of 2014-2015 with the jump in the exchange rate of the US dollar, as well as with a clearer manifestation of difficulties in the economy. And the difficult economic situation affects the banks, which are the same for the economy as the circulatory system for a person. In 2014-2015, Armenia's economic growth rate slowed down from 3.5% to 3%. Banks were affected by the deterioration of asset quality, problems arose even in large businesses, not to mention the retail sector. This is accompanied by an increase in reserves and a decrease in the profitability of the banking system. According to the forecasts of international organizations, the economic growth rate of Armenia in 2016 will be lower - 2.2%. Many experts compare 2016 with the peak of the 2009 crisis. All these manifestations are felt most heavily by the banking system, most of whose participants, in addition to bringing lending out of recession, must also ensure the requirement of the Central Bank to increase the capital to the normative scale of 30 billion drams by 2017. In fact, a serious transformation of the banking sector is inevitable, but the reduction of the number of players, along with their enlargement, will enable not only to independently withstand the shocks of the crisis, but also to contribute to the growth of the country's GDP at a proper level through lending to the key sectors of the economy.\nHow many participants will remain in the banking system in 2017?\nIn my opinion, it is enough to have only 10-11 banks in the banking system of Armenia, of which 5-6 will be major players - system-forming banks, and the rest will be niche banks, although the total number of banks may reach 15 by the end of the year. Half of the banks today face a serious capitalization problem. by 2017, the amount of capital should reach 30 billion drams. Moreover, most of them do not significantly reach the normative scale. No matter how the situation changes, it should be understood that the essence of development lies in it.\nWon't a significant reduction in the number of banks lead to monopolization of the market?\nI don't think it will lead to monopolization. Let me explain why, for example, in Georgia, two large banks share 70-75% of the market, and the rest goes to the other 18 banks. But even under such conditions, there is no pronounced monopolization of the banking system. And in Armenia, we are talking about the expansion of a healthy system, because having 10-11 banks is a completely sufficient indicator for our economy, under the conditions of the current population.\nWhat do you think, is the forecast of the growth of the banking system of Armenia in 2016 realistic?\nFirst of all, let me say that 2015 was a difficult year for Armenia. It was necessary to solve a number of problems, including dram devaluation, significant drop in transfers, drop in demand, etc. In fact, the banking system of Armenia did not grow in 2015. Yes, individual banks managed to grow in certain directions and parameters, but the system as a whole did not grow quantitatively. The year was also difficult in terms of qualitative indicators, as deteriorating asset quality forced banks to spend more on building up provisions for potential loan losses. As a result, the efficiency of the banking system decreased. 2016 will be a turning point, because the safety cushion was already created in 2015, the loan reserves were formed, and due to the careful analysis of the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, the growth of lending was restrained, as a result, banks accumulated large reserves to secure non-performing assets. In 2016, I still expect some improvement in asset quality, but even if that doesn't happen, it's unlikely to deteriorate. I think that there will even be a positive shift in the direction of development, the growth of key indicators, if, of course, banks manage to solve the problem of effective realization of the property pledged in terms of non-performing loans.\nIt turns out that the rescue of the drowning is in the hands of the drowning. And why, when the economy needs support, banks direct all necessary resources, even suffering losses, and when banks need support, then they have to rely on themselves.\nUnfortunately, it is. Each bank itself finds the methods of getting out of the created situation or the tools to replace them, including the potential buyers of real estate accumulated in banks as a result of non-performing loans. We see that the real estate market is illiquid, there was a drop in prices in 2015, naturally, this complicates the process of selling mortgaged property.\nWhat should the state do to address these negative consequences and what should the regulator do?\nOn the one hand, the regulator, in order to regulate the financial market, in December 2014, at the peak of the dram devaluation, tightened the mandatory reserve ratio (from 12% to 24%) for funds involved in foreign currency. This led to large costs, reducing the AMD lending to a minimum. In order to correct the situation related to lending, in 2015, the Regulator eased, in some cases reduced to zero, the mandatory reserve requirement for obligations in foreign currency and AMD in the case of placement of bank bonds in the domestic and foreign capital markets, as well as funds raised from international financial organizations for a period of more than 2 years. And it is an incentive to attract cheaper and long-term funds. In this regard, the Regulator correctly approached the solution of the created problems.\nAs for the government's steps, it is necessary to pay attention to easing the conditions for system-forming and export-oriented enterprises. It can be subsidies, cheap loans, as well as temporary tax holidays. As we can see, there are various methods of promotion, the consistent and active use of which will help domestic enterprises to maintain their position in the export sector during the difficult crisis period.\nDoesn't the substantial dominance of the volume of funds raised by banks (5.5 billion US dollars, including funds raised by international programs) over the volume of lending (4.7 billion US dollars) indicate serious problems of banks in terms of realization of funds in the crisis phase?\nIt will not be very correct to draw conclusions based on the indicators recorded during the crisis years. There can be many factors in the situation. In 2015, banks had to curb lending. First of all, it was dictated by the scarcity of funds in Armenian drams, and we know that consumer lending is carried out in drams. Second, the review of risk management in many banks provided for the tightening of requirements for potential borrowers, especially in terms of their ability to fulfill obligations in crisis conditions. Among the requirements for borrowers, the debt coverage ratio (DSCR - Dept Service Coverage Ratio) was first revised: it was tightened from the previous 1.1 to 1.4, that is, if the turnover or income falls by about 30%, problems may arise regarding the fulfillment of obligations to the bank. This is followed by collateral, the tightening of requirements for which was dictated by low liquidity and falling real estate prices. \nCrisis phenomena began to be felt in the middle of 2014, which deepened in 2015. How much the banks will be able to overcome this situation will be shown by 2016, which implies serious structural changes in the banking system.\nWhat role does Ameriabank reserve for itself in correcting the lending situation of the Armenian economy? Does the EBRD's participation in the replenishment of Ameriabank's capital make it possible to expect the involvement of large-scale funds from external sources?\nWe will receive 40 million US dollars (about 20 billion AMD) in the form of direct investments in the capital of Ameriabank, in two stages. Initially, within the framework of the additional issue, the EBRD invested 30 million USD (about 15 billion AMD), receiving 20% of the package of shares of Ameriabank, and the remaining 10 million USD is planned for future capital increase. By increasing the capital, Ameriabank's capital adequacy will reach 19%. In addition to EBRD funds, a subordinated loan of USD 50 million was provided by IFC.\nIt is clear that it is not possible to attract significant funds from domestic sources in a short period of time. And thanks to the mentioned 90 million US dollars, in fact, we have the opportunity to attract at least 500 million US dollars of additional funds from external sources, both from partners already working with us, and from new sources. We have already had a number of meetings with international financial organizations and banks that are interested in the Armenian financial market. In addition, our current partners, with whom we work quite successfully on various projects, have expressed their desire to continue cooperation with us through additional funding.\nIn case of attracting such large funds, will the bank not face the difficulty of their effective allocation?\nI wouldn't say it's a challenge, it's more of a problem that needs to be solved. Of course, there is the concern that the market is not comprehensive and therefore cannot accept huge amounts of funds, whatever their price. That is why we are planning to implement the process in stages within 1-2 years. Of course, from the point of view of efficiency, it would be better for the bank to immediately use this opportunity to increase profitable assets. However, knowing the size of the market and the existing demand, we are going to implement these funds in stages. For example, next year we are going to increase credit investments by 100-130 million US dollars, but if the demand still exceeds our expectations, then this amount can be larger, especially since we have the opportunity to quickly attract additional funds from our partners.\nThere are big and good projects that need financial support, both for lending and further promotion, and we are talking about serious funds, and accordingly, the bank must have a significant amount of capital. Ameriabank's position in terms of attracting and lending to large taxpayer clients is quite strong.\nWhich areas are prioritized in Ameriabank's credit policy?\nWe are very interested in the field of agribusiness, in particular, the construction of greenhouses, 80-90% of the products of which are exported to Russia. We are also interested in the fields of energy and mining, and in terms of the latter, despite the decrease in international prices of energy and mining raw materials, the demand for products remains. And that's why we feel very comfortable lending to mining companies. We are also very interested in the telecommunications sector, where we have projects and in 2016 we plan to lend a number of new projects.\nSMEs are within the scope of Ameriabank's targeted lending. We will always pay great attention to this direction and make SME loan products as attractive as possible in order to increase our customer base in this segment.\nDo you foresee an M&A opportunity in addition to lending?\nYes, we have never ruled out the possibility of M&A (merger and merger) with one or more banks. To say more, we receive and discuss such proposals from time to time. We look very closely at the performance of banks that may be of interest to us in terms of acquisition or merger. There aren't many of them, but they are there nonetheless. It all depends on the price.\nI think that 2016 will be very interesting in terms of unification and strengthening of the banking system, at least in 2015 we saw the beginning of that process, two merger transactions took place (ProCredit Bank with Inecobank, and BTA Bank with Armeconombank). At the beginning of 2017, we will already see a new banking system with serious structural changes, stronger and more stable.\nEBRD, as a rule, offers both corporate governance and risk management mechanisms from participating in the capital of any bank. Are you taking advantage of this opportunity?\nWe have sufficiently developed corporate governance mechanisms that meet international standards. But, realizing that a reputable shareholder like EBRD can have a new coin in improving corporate governance, we will of course take advantage of their suggestions. The same can be said about risk management. We are always open to such suggestions. And today, the goal of the EBRD project is to support the capitalization of Ameriabank, contributing to the realization of its strategic growth goals, with the final goal of the IPO (initial public offering of shares) in the future.\nAmeriabank's IPO plans are quite intriguing. When do you plan to enter the international capital market?\nThey are not plans for the coming year, we understand well that IPO is not an end in itself, we have to work consistently to achieve that goal. We need to ensure greater growth, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and of course the external environment should also be favorable for the implementation of the IPO.\nThe new format of cooperation with the Eurobank is aimed at the implementation of a more ambitious strategy, in particular, entering international markets with an initial public offering (IPO). IFC's subordinated loan will also help prepare for the IPO.\nWhat kind of trend in interest rates can be expected in 2016 and what could be the reason for this?\nYou don't have to wait for interest rates to drop. Let me tell you why. First, attracting funds in the domestic market in AMD is an expensive pleasure. In other words, we should take into account repo rates, the yield of securities, including government bonds, as well as deposit interest rates, when pricing loans in AMD. This is about AMD funds. And I don't foresee significant fluctuations in terms of US dollar funds either, because, first of all, the pricing is affected by the Libor rate, which is directly related to the US Federal Reserve rate, which increased by 0.25 in 2015, with the prospect of an increase in 2016. , secondly, it is the country risk, which is not moving in a positive direction for now, and thirdly, it is the corporate risk (borrower's risk), that is, the tendency of the fluctuation of interest rates of funds in USD will be insignificant - 0.5%. Ameriabank will finance large projects on the most favorable terms for the borrower.\nIs Ameriabank planning to expand its branch network, or is the focus still on expanding remote services?\nIn 2016, we plan to open two new branches, one in the capital and the other in the region, as a result of which the total number of branches will reach 14. In addition, we are expanding the number of quick customer service points. Two such points are already operating today, and we are going to open four more in the republic in 2016. They are cash-in/cash-out ATMs, kiosks, internet banking. We prefer the use of new technological methods of customer service, plus the quality of service, rather than the further expansion of the branch network. Among them, we are talking about the new investor, the BankWorld remote banking self-service system of the Irish company CR2, which will be available at the end of 2016. This initiative is aimed at the implementation of one of the strategic goals of the bank, in particular, to offer customers a complete package of innovative banking services through modern technologies, which implies a single platform for all remote banking services, which will ensure the maximum convenience of performing banking functions for customers. At the same time, this system will contribute to the development of the culture of remote banking services in Armenia.\nSource: arminfo.am",

        "title": "Andrey Mkrtchyan. \"We look to the future with optimism\"",
        "content": "What is expected of the RA banking system in 2016, are new opportunities opening up in difficult situations, and why is size so important for the bank? Andrey Mkrtchyan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ameriabank, presented all this in his interview. The reason for the interview was the signing of transactions by Ameriabank with the two largest international financial institutions, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Specifically, EBRD's $40 million investment in Ameriabank's capital, and IFC's $50 million subordinated loan to Ameriabank.\n \nMr. Mkrtchyan, it is often said that a crisis is a time of new opportunities. In your opinion, to what extent does the current crisis open up new opportunities?\nI would not rush to characterize the current period as a crisis. However, there is no doubt that now is really a very difficult time for Armenia, the region, and it is already obvious that it is also for the whole world. Such a situation mobilizes, concentrates and forces everyone, both business entities and households, to observe the circumstances, evaluate critically, \"inventory\" the status quo, give up on some less important things, make difficult decisions that were previously postponed. This is indeed a window of opportunity to clean up, get rid of excess burden, increase efficiency, restructure the company in order to have a more adequate response to existing challenges. At the same time, it is also an opportunity for companies to proactively and aggressively increase market share, enter new niches for the company, as well as an opportunity to increase the likelihood of mergers and acquisition deals, as companies with poor management or inefficient or problematic systems stand out. faced with difficulties, are unable to cope with them and ultimately become more flexible in making important strategic decisions.\nIn this period of economic and political unpredictability, how relevant is the deal with EBRD and IFC?\nI don't think the situation is unpredictable. From an economic point of view, it is complex but predictable. From a political perspective, there is generally no such thing as a quiet period or a relatively predictable year, especially since we are in a complex geopolitical region. As for the deals with EBRD and IFC, we didn't sign them for more stability, we are already one of the most stable banks. These transactions enable us to use capital to expand our operations for both organic and inorganic growth. We intend to use our funds both for mergers and acquisition transactions and for raising additional resources. In the long term, these investments will help us prepare for an initial public offering (IPO).\nAmeriabank's assets have already crossed the threshold of 1 billion US dollars, which is a record indicator for our banking system. Capital increase following deals with EBRD and IFC provides new opportunities for growth. What business development plans do you associate with those deals?\nI consider the fact that Ameriabank's assets exceeded the threshold of 1 billion dollars a historical event in our banking system. During the 25 years of Armenia's independence, it is the first time that the Armenian bank reaches such an indicator. It is very important and symbolic for us. As a result of concluding transactions with EBRD and IFC, Ameriabank's regulatory capital has doubled, which opens up new growth opportunities for us, primarily because now we can lend to large corporate projects, which no Armenian bank was able to do alone before. did not implement. We can double the bank's assets in the next few years. As I have already said, the non-organic growth strategy is relevant for us, and now, thanks to the capital increase, we hope to conclude merger and acquisition deals this year, as a result of which Ameriabank's capital will grow even more. In terms of our ambitions, our IPO plans, this is another important step. It should be recognized that for many institutional investors around the world, regardless of their attitude towards the country or region, the size of the company is important. The size of the bank also matters in terms of greater access to international financial markets. This is important for us, despite the fact that we have always actively cooperated with international financial institutions and are now the leader of the banking system of Armenia in attracting foreign capital. We have attracted about 500 million USD from international financial institutions, a number of major players have opened credit lines for us, and it is especially important that these credit lines have been opened without a security measure. By the way, we are the first Armenian bank that works with European and American banks practically without a security measure. I should mention that unsecured credit lines of hundreds of millions of dollars testify to the trust in our bank and high assessment of the quality of our work.\nAccording to you, which problems are the most relevant for the banking system today? How do you feel about the process of enlargement of the banking sector in Armenia?\nToday, the main problem of Armenian banks is the quality of the loan portfolio. Unfortunately, in such difficult times, the deterioration of the banks' loan portfolio is inevitable. As much as we think that Armenia is not integrated into the world economy, we are part of this world, a world that is globalized and interconnected. Therefore, it is obvious that the drop in oil prices and the devaluation of the Russian ruble led to the fact that many of the Armenian exporters are unable to make real profit from exports, to effectively and successfully organize the export of their products to the markets of Russia and the CIS countries. Naturally, the problems of exporting companies affect the quality of assets of Armenian banks. And in my opinion, the main task of the banking system is to resist the deterioration of asset quality, which is a very serious challenge. At the same time, the reduction in the volume of private transfers by more than a third virtually eliminated local demand and the financial potential of the local market, and a serious fall in the prices of copper and gold became the result of the second wave. \nThe increase in provisioning for possible loan losses and the write-off of bad debts from the balance sheet lead to a decrease in the capital adequacy ratio, and this is in the event that the capital adequacy indicators of Armenian banks are already low in recent years.\nNow that problem can become even more tangible and relevant, hindering the attraction of new capital and investors. And for that, in the second half of the year, in the context of raising the minimum regulatory capital limit by the Central Bank of Armenia, the consolidation process in the local market will gain new momentum. We will see mergers and acquisitions, and some players will exit the market. Turning to my attitude towards enlargement, I should say that, in my opinion, the optimal number of banks for a country of this size and GDP structure is no more than ten.\nOur economy is quite centralized in nature and small banks are unable to adequately reflect the demands and needs of the real sector. The first two or three players in almost all sectors of our economy are larger than any Armenian bank, that's why no single bank is able to serve such large customers, and forming banking associations or syndicates, unfortunately, is not successful, first of all, to attract due to difficulties in securing and separating financial flows.\nA second argument in favor of scaling up is that small banks do not have access to long-term and cheap resources in foreign markets. In addition, in difficult times, given the deterioration in asset quality, banks need capital to help them weather the difficulties. And again, you have to be a big bank to have serious reserves and big opportunities. Another argument in favor of scaling up is that Armenian banks currently lag behind their regional neighbors in the use of global software products, risk and business management systems. Bank software implementation requires serious investments and in this respect the size of the bank also matters.\nWhat trends in the development of the banking system do you expect this year?\nCurrently, the banking system is actively negotiating acquisitions. I think 2016 will be the year of recovery and refinement of the banking system, banks will merge, expand and enter a new stage of development. 2016 all banks will focus on retail banking and small and medium businesses as the least risky segments.\nIn general, I think we should get used to the idea that global and regional processes directly affect our country's economy. We are part of the global system, so economic problems in China, an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve in the United States, or a devaluation of the ruble in Russia will inevitably affect our economy. Therefore, we must build our model with the logic of the cyclical nature of the global economy, so that we can adequately manage risks in both downturns and booms. At the same time, we look very positively at the future, we believe in the growth potential of Armenia's economy, otherwise we would not invest resources, we would not build long-term plans. Evaluating the situation in the long term, you understand that you just have to overcome certain periods. We started working in 2008 at the height of the crisis. If we had been pessimistic about the situation and had not made our plans for the coming years, we would not be where we are now. So we should always look to the future with optimism and respond adequately to the challenges that will always be there.\nPanArmenian.net",

        "content": "Banks.am's interview with International Finance Corporation (IFC) South Caucasus Director Jan Van Bilsen\nHow do you assess the prospects of Armenia's banking sector in the face of increasing economic vulnerability?\nThe countries of the region, including Armenia, are still adjusting to the new economic reality. In the conditions of increasing economic vulnerability, we attach importance to increasing the assistance provided to Armenian banks, with the aim of helping them to strengthen and increase confidence in the country's banking sector. Our recent efforts to support Ameriabank, the largest bank in Armenia, are part of this strategy.\nIFC has a fruitful experience of cooperation with Ameriabank, which is gradually expanding. Does this mean you are satisfied with the results?\n- Since 2009, we have been effectively cooperating with Ameriabank in various fields, from direct lending to currency swaps. For example, IFC's Global Trade Finance Program has helped the bank finance a number of important strategic projects in Armenia. Our partnership has also helped finance small hydropower plants, increasing the country's supply of renewable energy.\n2013 Ameriabank was also the underwriter of IFC bonds, which was the first placement by a non-resident issuer and the first corporate bond issued by a non-resident in the capital markets of Armenia.\nOn January 21, we took a new step in our partnership with Ameriabank by providing it with a $50 million loan that will help increase the bank's capital and expand programs to support local businesses, which will stimulate economic growth.\nOur six-year subordinated loan will help the bank continue its growth and prepare for an initial public offering (IPO).\nWe look forward to continuing to work together to further promote the growth of the private sector in Armenia and strengthen the country's banking sector.\nIFC's subordinated loan will support Ameriabank's capital for further lending to the economy. Which sectors of the industry will these funds be directed to?\nThe bank, as a creditor, makes the final decision about its borrowers and the industries in which they operate. Overall, we expect our financing to expand the bank's ability to lend to local businesses across a range of industries, helping to spur economic growth and create new jobs.\nAmeriabank's assets exceeded $1 billion. How important is the existence of such a large bank for the further development of the Armenian banking sector and the general economy? What do you expect from a closer cooperation with Ameriabank, i.e. a subordinated debt transaction?\nA well-developed banking sector is very important for the development of any economy, so the growth of Ameriabank, which is the largest bank in the country, has an important role for the overall stability of the sector.\nHow do you assess the current economic situation in the region?\nThe global economy is still fragile, and this affects the region, where the environment is extremely complex. Several countries in the region, including Armenia, continue to adjust to this new economic reality. In such times, international financial institutions such as the IFC can play an important role in supporting the development of the private sector in Armenia and beyond.\nIn our opinion, the private sector in Armenia, and such sectors as agribusiness and mining, have strong potential. This fiscal year, IFC plans to invest more than $100 million to support private clients in Armenia, our largest annual program in the country.\nDo you intend to continue supporting the development of the stock market in Armenia?\n2013 we issued IFC's inaugural bond in Armenian dram. Issuing the first \"Sevan\" bond, which became the 2014 the largest corporate bond in circulation in Armenia, we became the first non-resident issuer of local currency bonds in the country's domestic capital market. This is part of a larger IFC program in which, depending on market needs, we plan to issue multiple bonds with the aim of strengthening Armenia's capital market and boosting private sector lending.\nSource: banks.am",

        "title": "How to attract investors?",
        "content": "Foreign investments play a huge role in the development of the economy. Why Armenian companies find it difficult to attract foreign investments, how to increase the investment attractiveness of the country, and are there hopes for the development of capital markets in Armenia - we talked about all this with Arno Mosikyan, Director of Investment Banking Operations of Ameriabank.\nMr. Mosikyan, how favorable is Armenia's investment environment for attracting resources?\nYour question is quite broad and multifaceted, and it is difficult to answer it in one short interview. First, the question should be considered from two perspectives: do we intend to discuss portfolio investment in the capital markets or direct investment in the real sector? I propose not to address macroeconomic stability, state strategy for economic development, transparency of state institutions, and other issues for the time being.\nTo be honest, in terms of direct investment in the real sector, the private sector always faces difficulties. Since its establishment, Ameriabank has actively cooperated with foreign investors who invest not only in the banking sector, but also in other branches of the economy. We understand quite well the requirements of foreign investors and know the difficulties they face throughout the investment process.\nBefore \"selling\" any investment idea, company share or project to foreign investors, Armenian companies spend a lot of time and resources to thoroughly explain why the investor should invest in Armenia and in the Armenian company, under which country's jurisdiction to work. What is Armenia, what are its strategic benchmarks, what are the country's comparative competitive advantages, how do the main laws work, laws on the protection of the rights of foreign investors, normative acts, etc.? In other words, it is obvious that we still have a lot to do to promote our country in the international arena.\nIn order to be able to assess the investment attractiveness of Armenia for ourselves, we need to study and understand the perception of Armenia among those investors who have at least invested in the region (Transcaucasia, CIS or South-Eastern Europe). What associations does Armenia evoke, how is the country positioned, how do investors imagine Armenia? If you ask me, I can say that apart from Mount Ararat, Noah's Ark, maybe brandy, and most importantly, Kim Kardashian, Armenia is unfortunately not associated with anything else that is important for business, that can generate interest in investments. \nIf we talk about attracting portfolio investments in the capital markets, there are other factors that need to be paid attention to, in particular, how developed the infrastructure of the capital market is, what investment products are offered, how extensive and liquid the market for these products is, whether they are connected the main trading platform and the largest part of the market - the government bond sector - to the global systems of trading, clearing, custody, at what stage of development are the joint-stock companies.\nIf a few years ago I could say that the state can activate the stock market through the initial placement of shares (IPO) of some infrastructure companies, now there are almost no assets of interest to investors left in the hands of the state. Almost everything has been privatized, so there are fewer and fewer instruments left under the control of the state. We saw that even after the changes to the Tax Code, the stock market did not activate. \nStrange as it may seem, in this context it is sometimes difficult to explain the behavior of some government bodies. Imagine a real situation where some officials who represent the state, the issuer of Armenia's sovereign Eurobonds, refuse to meet with large institutional investors (unheard of) who have invested in Armenia's Eurobonds and visit Armenia once a year to assess the investment environment, fiscal politics, the macroeconomic situation and decide whether to continue to hold the bonds or to \"throw\" them back into the market. If our goal is to increase investment attractiveness and generate interest in our country, this is just a step in the opposite direction...\nI would like to mention that in October this year in New York, the Government of Armenia and the Development Fund of Armenia are holding an investment forum with the financing of the Asian Development Bank, in which investors from different countries and the Diaspora will participate. The forum is held with the support of an international consortium led by the Ameria consulting company, and of which the American Pragma company is a member. The purpose of the forum is to present to investors those branches of the Armenian economy that have the greatest potential for development with a thorough analysis of investment opportunities.\nThis is quite an interesting topic, on which we can talk for a long time, but I think that your question can be summarized with the following conclusion: there are definitely \"prescriptions\" to increase the investment attractiveness of Armenia, it is necessary to qualitatively analyze the changes taking place in the region, to respond quickly and be ready to engage in the processes taking place at the right time, not to miss the moment. ...can Armenia become an outpost for portfolio investments in the capital market of Iran in the West, which we hope will open in the near future, or take advantage of the de-offshore situation in Russia and replace the jurisdiction of Cyprus for Russian private financial investment capital? whether Armenia's agro-industrial complex can take a significant position in some markets of agricultural products of Russia and other countries due to the latest technologies... these are questions that are waiting for their \"heroes\" both at the state level and at the private sector level.\nArmenian companies that do not have an international credit history are deprived of the opportunity to attract funds from international financial institutions. You already have experience in attracting debt funds from international financial institutions for Armenian companies. Will EBRD and IFC participation in the capital of the bank make it easier to attract now?\nIt is not so. certainly, a \"clean\" credit history and a high credit rating help to attract funds faster and on more attractive terms, but their absence does not mean that the non-public market of international debt capital is closed for such Armenian companies. \nIn 2008, when we practically started our activity as a commercial bank from scratch, Ameriabank was also in a similar situation. Yes, it took us a lot of effort and energy to cooperate with international financial institutions, but the result of these efforts was that we attracted a long-term resource of about 500 million dollars for the country's economy, we were awarded a rating equal to the country's rating by the Fitch agency, the Netherlands Development Bank (FMO) ) signed an unprecedented deal: a convertible subordinated loan agreement of USD 20 million, with IFC, the largest subordinated loan attraction deal in the history of Armenia - USD 50 million, and with EBRD, the largest deal to acquire a one-time equity participation in the Bank's capital in the region ( 40 million USD).\nNow, with our help, it is certainly easier for Armenian companies to attract funds from international financial institutions. We have been working in this direction for 5 years, among our clients are large Armenian manufacturers and companies working in various branches of the economy.\nBut I must say that the mere desire to bring in investments and pay for Ameriabank's services is not enough to obtain debt and equity financing from international financial institutions. Working with such partners implies a completely new level of transparency of financial reports, quality of corporate management and professionalism of management staff, lack of interconnection with state bodies, as well as the presence of a system for controlling the impact on the environment and social environment. Of course, all of this obviously involves high costs: hiring a reputable auditing company, professional managers, implementing an internal control system, but the benefit is much greater. As a result, the client receives a long-term credit resource with a relatively low interest rate, while local commercial banks practically do not offer financing on the same terms.\nAmeriabank's conclusion of transactions with EBRD and IFC will not only make access to external financial resources easier, but will also radically change the situation in the banking market of Armenia. In the past, large Armenian companies forming a system attracted syndicated loans from international banks without turning to Armenian commercial banks, because the latter's capital size, credit rating, and therefore the cost of credit funds did not allow them to offer more competitive terms compared to international banks. As you know, according to the regulations of the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia, banks have restrictions on the maximum volume of loans provided to one borrower or one investment project. This norm depends on the size of the bank's normative capital. After concluding transactions with EBRD and IFC, Ameriabank's regulatory capital has increased significantly (almost doubled), so the bank can now lend to larger and more important projects for the country's economy, which in turn will lead to the next chain reaction - local banking resources will be used in Armenian investment projects, interest income will remain in the country, banks will get more profit (new jobs), the budget will get more taxes.\nIn addition, Ameriabank and EBRD can co-finance investment projects, which will at least double the bank's lending potential.\nOne of the strategic goals of EBRD, including in Armenia, is the development of capital markets. From this point of view, what prospects does such cooperation open for Ameriabank?\nThere is no doubt that the close cooperation between Armenia's largest investment bank and EBRD will be fruitful for Armenia's capital markets. However, we should not expect that we will be able to dramatically accelerate the development of the market, after all, we are a commercial organization and we need to make a profit for our shareholders. Of course, if we can make a profit at the same time, and contribute to the development of the infrastructure, the market, creating new tools for investments, we will only be happy. \nAs you rightly mentioned, the development of Armenia's capital market is one of the most important issues for the EBRD, and the EBRD has been working for a long time to improve the infrastructure and create the preconditions for developing the market.\nThe EBRD's priority agenda issues for the next few years are outlined in the \"EBRD Strategy for Armenia\", which is built on three main components: improving the competitiveness of the private sector through the development of companies' capabilities, transparency of corporate governance and business environment, capital market development and improvement of access to long-term financial resources, development of commercial and quality public infrastructure companies.\nIn all these directions, Ameriabank has something to offer to the EBRD as its partner in Armenia, to its clients, and to the state, and we hope for a fruitful future cooperation.\nLragir.am",

It became the first placement of a non-resident issuer in Armenia and the first foreign corporate bond issued on the Armenian capital market.\nWhy did IFC choose Ameriabank as a subordinated loan partner?\nSince 2009, the bank has been a valued partner of IFC in many areas, including trade finance and small hydropower lending programs aimed at increasing the country's supply of renewable energy. in 2013 Ameriabank was also the underwriter of the IFC bond, which became the largest corporate bond in circulation in Armenia in 2014. \nWe look forward to continuing to work together to help the bank achieve its strategic goals and prepare for an initial public offering (IPO). A well-developed banking sector is very important for the development of any economy, so the growth of Ameriabank, the largest bank in the country, is important for the overall stability of the sector.\nHow does the transaction with Ameriabank contribute to the implementation of IFC's medium-term plans for its presence in Armenia and the region?\nAmeriabank is one of our main partner banks here. As I already mentioned, our assistance to the bank is aimed at increasing the stability of the banking sector in Armenia. It is also part of a wider regional strategy to support strong banks that provide vital financial services to local businesses, particularly SMEs, which are the main drivers of job creation in developing countries. For example, in 2014 IFC's client banks in the countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia provided more than 5.7 million current loans to micro, small and medium enterprises, amounting to 81 billion. with a total amount of USD.\nWill subprime credit, as a new form of financial transaction for Armenia's financial sector, affect the general sector?\nBy providing capital to one of our key partner banks in Armenia, we are contributing to its growth strategy and the implementation of future projects that we believe will contribute to the overall stability of the banking sector in Armenia.",

        "content": "There is good news in the Armenian banking market. \"Ameriabank\" CJSC signed two major deals with international financial institutions. According to the signed agreements, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) invests 40 million dollars in order to acquire a package of shares of Ameriabank, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) provides a subordinated loan of 50 million dollars to Ameriabank. Thus, Ameriabank, which is the leader in the banking system of Armenia, increases its capital to such an extent that it becomes an unbeatable leader in the banking market of Armenia. In a conversation with a NEWS.am reporter, Andrey Mkrtchyan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of \"Ameriabank\" CJSC, summarized some results of the bank's activities and presented the plans for the future.\nMr. Mkrtchyan, 2007 \"Ameria\" group of companies acquired Armenartbank, which \"had nothing but authority and a rich history\". This is exactly how you described the bank in one of the interviews. Today, Ameriabank is the leader of the Armenian banking system, the bank's assets have exceeded 1 billion dollars. How did you manage to achieve such outstanding results in such a short time?\nYes, we acquired the bank in 2007. at the end of the year and in 2008 We started active work in January. It was a small bank with a capital of $9 million, assets of $45 million, and a staff of around 30 employees, including administrative and technical staff. Today, when we summarize 2015 the results, Ameriabank's assets already exceed 1 billion dollars, the total regulatory capital reaches the threshold of 200 million dollars, and the number of employees is around 600. Ameriabank is the largest financial institution in Armenia by all major indicators. We are the largest lender in the Armenian economy, having the largest corporate loan portfolio.\nDuring these years, we have directed more than 2 billion dollars to finance various sectors of Armenia's economy, including more than 200 million dollars to export promotion, more than 350 million dollars to lending to small and medium businesses, and the Bank's financial mediation in 2007. from 0.09% in 2014 reached 5.91%.\nAmeriabank is the largest taxpayer among Armenian banks, and ranks 15th among the country's largest taxpayers. At the same time, we are one of the most efficient financial institutions, taking leading positions in terms of such indicators as return on capital, profit, revenue per employee, assets per employee, etc.\nWe managed to achieve all this thanks to a unique philosophy, corporate culture and the spirit of American meritocracy. At the core of this culture are human qualities and people's professionalism, not positions or positions. Our company has a flat management organizational structure, which allows to reduce the number of hierarchical levels. It is a partnership that allows key members of the management staff to acquire a share in the company due to the results of their own work, to increase that share and to influence the results of the company's activities with the quality of their own work. We evaluate all our successes in the context of a long-term perspective. We start and continue the work of life, not just a project that has a beginning and an end. We believe in the potential of our company, the economy and the country where we live and work.\nAt the beginning of this journey, we looked twenty years ahead and built our strategy based on that. In particular, we made very serious investments in the development of the technological sector (at that time everyone laughed at us), we allocated no less serious funds to the development of the universal bank model. we were developing all directions of our business in an adequate and balanced way. It was not a priority for us to get short-term profit at the moment, but we invested in the development of relations with clients, our staff, our team. All these factors together with our shareholding structure, customer loyalty, choosing the right time for making key decisions led to the fact that we managed to implement our plans and turn the small company into a champion of the local market, one of the largest players in the financial market of the region and the largest player in the financial sector of our country.\nAmeriabank has been the leader of the Armenian banking market for three years. After signing the agreements with EBRD and IFC, Ameriabank's capital increases significantly. With all this, what prospects are opened for Ameriabank and maybe for the economy of Armenia in general?\nAfter closing these deals, our capital has effectively doubled, which will allow us to nearly double our assets. New perspectives and unique opportunities are indeed opening before us. As you know, Armenia's GDP has a centralized structure. For example, mining accounts for one third of exports. The minimum amount of credit requested within the framework of one project in this field is 30-50 million dollars, and no Armenian bank was able to serve such applications alone. The bank's expansion opens up new opportunities to enter international capital markets and B2B financing markets. It is also a good opportunity to develop in the conditions of global upheavals, to start new bank transformation projects in difficult times, to support sectors of the economy in need of financial support and prospective players in these sectors. At the same time, along with the growth of the bank, we have access to international best practices, unique software solutions, modern technological products that are used in many countries of the world. The introduction of such solutions and products requires serious investments, and in this respect the size of the bank is of key importance, because the balance sheet of the bank must allow costs comparable to the scale of the business.\nWhat changes are expected in the bank's corporate governance system after EBRD's acquisition of share capital?\nEven before signing a deal with the EBRD, we had a goal and ambitious plans to enter the international capital markets, that is, to carry out an IPO (initial public placement), which will probably be the first Armenian IPO in the international arena. In that regard, we started an internal IPO project a few years ago. All the processes and changes taking place in the bank are carried out within the framework of that complex project and with the corresponding logic, which also includes changes in the corporate management system. Our Board of Directors has included an independent director for a long time, there are committees attached to the Board of Directors, and within the framework of corporate changes, we are currently forming three committees attached to the Board of Directors in accordance with the best practices of international capital markets. In this sense, the participation of EBRD and the new level of partnership with IFC make our project even more special. 2016 in the meantime, the Board of Directors of Ameriabank will be supplemented by an independent director who will represent EBRD, and we will continue the global changes of the bank's corporate governance system.\nThe management of Ameriabank announced that the bank plans to carry out an IPO in 2016, if the state of the global and local economy is stable. Have your plans changed?\nWe're headed for an IPO. And we have a very good idea of how complex this process is, what kind of internal resources are required. A few years ago, we announced an IPO as a 2014 internal goal for our team, then moved that date to 2016. Now it is obvious to us that in 2018-19 soon it is impossible. Let me explain why. The reason is not only the difficult economic situation in the world, in the region and in our country. There are many other important factors to consider. We have engaged consultants, we are working with large investment banks and we understand that for the IPO to be successful, the placement volume should be at least 80-100 million dollars. The share of the minimum placement volume in the bank's capital cannot exceed 30-40%. Simple calculations show that the bank needs another 150-200 million dollars of capital to ensure this indicator. Taking into account the multipliers affecting the possible price during the placement, the capital of the bank should be 250-300 million dollars in order to successfully carry out an IPO even in the range of 50-80 million dollars. Currently, we are close to the threshold of 200 million dollars and we realize that we are still far from our goal. That's why we intend to conclude merger and acquisition transactions to increase the bank's capital to at least 250-300 million dollars and to carry out a liquid placement of shares in the capital market. These are the internal problems before us. Naturally, the external environment must also be favorable for conducting an IPO.\nThe IPO is not an end in itself, but a way to attract adequate, fair and fair value resources that will reflect the quality of our assets to ensure the next stages of development. That is why it is necessary to work consistently, ensure intensive and extensive growth and wait for the right moment. I would like to note that investors value not only the size of the bank, but also its profitability, return on capital, quality of the credit portfolio.\nWhat is Ameriabank's future strategy? What growth indicators have you set for yourself?\nOne of the strategies I have already touched upon is access to international capital markets. And now our task is to grow both organically and non-organically, to grow by ensuring maximum profitability, to increase the rate of return on capital to 20%, to improve the quality of assets, to include all sectors of our economy and to lead the organization in the direction of a universal bank. By the way, we have been implementing the non-organic growth strategy for three years. As you know, we have a successful experience in acquiring the loan portfolio of Cascade Bank, Norvik UAC. We hope that already this year we will be able to apply this experience to other similar projects and increase capital through merger and acquisition transactions.\nAs for growth benchmarks, twice a year we hold strategic meetings to assess the situation in Armenia and the region, to identify the structure, nature and direction of possible problems, as well as to determine those sectors of the economy that will be least affected by the mentioned processes. Each year we define for ourselves the areas on which we focus our attention. At the moment, it is small and medium business, which also provides an opportunity to diversify certain risks, diversification of cooperation with exporters, and of course, retail banking. For eight years, we have been very actively and successfully developing both the corporate sector, the investment banking sector, and the retail business. However, in terms of existing potential, we are not yet satisfied with the balance in retail activity to truly consider ourselves a universal bank. Although in absolute terms we are one of the largest retail banks in Armenia, in relative terms retail activity is still below 40% of our balance sheet.\nMr. Mkrtchyan, Ameriabank also successfully implements a strategy of social responsibility, actively engages in charity. However, this information can be found on the bank's website by anyone who specifically searches for it.\nWe take our social responsibilities very seriously, but we don't really like to talk about it...\nHowever, you summarize certain results of seven years of work, and I think that our readers will also be interested in this side of your activity.\nOur corporate social responsibility strategy includes various programs. Some of them, for example, refer to art. As you know, we supported the initiative of holding an international jazz festival in Yerevan, for seven years we sponsored the concerts of such musicians in Armenia as Al Gero, George Benson, Nino Katamadze. We support young people in their professional growth, innovation-oriented and various other initiatives.\nWe also actively finance orphanages and hospitals. For several years in a row, we have been supporting children with serious illnesses by organizing New Year's events, which include our clients, partners and our team. As a rule, the bank doubles the income received from such events and transfers it to a number of foundations in Armenia for the purpose of treating children.\nWe have an extensive and carefully developed social responsibility program, which we implement and will continue to implement.\nSource: news.am",

BlogNews attended the \"Robot Parade\" where the tour guides introduced us to the robots. \nIn the lobby, we got to know the robot family: the robot father, who is a soldier, the robot son, who loves cars, and the robot mother, who, like all mothers, does housework. Robot Baxter was created to work in factories. Once an action is performed, the robot can repeat it as often as it is instructed to do that action. It picks up, carries, folds clothes, packs, arranges, makes coffee, can lift up to 5 kg. It has 7 different types of paws that can be changed. The robot rotates 360 degrees, is sensitive, can detect people while working and does not hit, when it senses danger or a loud scream, it stops working. In other words, Baxter represents the future generation of industrial robots. Robot Nanny is an active, mischievous robot that watches over a child while their parents are away. This electronic \"babysitter\" monitors the baby's eye activity, and as soon as the baby wakes up, it sends a signal to the parents' phone and ensures that the parents are present to communicate with the baby. To connect to the robot, you just need to turn on the appropriate program or application on the tablet, which does not require special skills.\nMr. Robot is a therapeutic robot with the appearance of a harp seal pup. It has the same properties as animals. It is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as an anti-stress remedy because when you pet it, it calms the nerves. Mr. mostly visits nursing homes and orphanages, where there is a need for special care and tenderness. \nThe Robot Bartender can mix 7 different types of drinks and prepare a delicious cocktail.

Robot Boris. if you want to attend some event, but you can't, you can send Boris instead of you, he will record everything and ensure your presence at the given place. \nRobot Beggar, or Sonka, as he is otherwise called, is made of wood, and perhaps that is what makes him so charming and different. According to the tour guides, this robot really wants to have an iron outfit one day and to that end he walks the streets, collects money, blesses and sings for the person who gives the money. However, Sonka is very afraid of people and calls for help if touched. \nRobot Yosha was ordered by the owner of one of the restaurants in Kharkiv. He is a waiter, he approaches the table, takes the order and serves it without mistakes.\nA talented robot Artist accurately draws everything that is assigned to him by the computer. draws in one color and without interruption. \nThe basketball-playing robot was originally designed to do hard work in manufacturing, but in the Robot Parade, it plays basketball. accurately throws the ball into the basket and never misses. \nWith the help of Robot Soccer, football fans can play their favorite game, and Robot Ping Pong plays tennis and is very specialized. Delivers 25-80 balls per minute, depending on programming. \nRobot Thespian is the most charming and attracts the most attention of visitors. He interacts with guests, asks questions, answers questions, sings, dances and even falls in love. And when they take a selfie with him, he makes sure to mention how many times they took a selfie with him that day. \nRobozags is getting married. gives a marriage certificate, rings and a wedding photo as a keepsake. He even notices and comments on couples' emotions. \nThe most flexible robots we've ever seen: Dancing Robots.

It's a must see. \nRobots produced in Armenia are presented at the booth of the Union of Information Technology Enterprises. Any plastic part can be grown using a 3D printer. By the way, the program specially for children is written in native language, that is, the children themselves can \"create\" a computer game for themselves.\nAmeriabank also has its own robot, which is in the form of a terminal and allows you to manage accounts and make transfers. \nThe \"Ayb\" school-pavilion was very impressive, where the students of the school show the robots they have made, for example, one robot is a firefighter, the other one gets out of the most complicated mazes because it moves parallel to the wall.

In particular, the panel discussion \"Is the spread of remote banking services justified in Armenia\" organized by Ameriabank was held recently in Yerevan, which was attended by representatives of Ameriabank, HSBC Bank Armenia, Beeline and Ucom telecommunications companies, the Central Bank of Armenia, as well as information security experts and representatives of IT companies. The participants discussed the modern trends of banking services, as well as the prospects of using remote services in Armenia.\nDigital banking is the strategy of the future\nThe use of digital technologies for the global banking business is not new, but these technologies are still gaining momentum for Armenian banks. It should be noted that only this year, Armenian banks began to actively introduce various means of remote service, in particular, online-banking and mobile-banking.\nAccording to the study carried out by \"Ameria\" consulting company, only three of the 21 banks operating in Armenia do not have an online banking service intended for individuals. At the same time, the survey organized by the company in 11 cities of the country showed that the share of online banking users among bank clients in 2014 was 2 percent compared to 1.3 percent recorded in 2013.\nHowever, Armenian banks have a great field to develop against the background of global trends. Thus, the global indicator of the use of online-banking services is 28-7%, and the users of North America (48%) and Europe (37.8%) are more active. And the most active users of online banking live in Iceland (91%).\nDespite the low rates of use of remote means of service by the population of Armenia, market experts believe that digital banking is the strategy of the future banking business in Armenia. According to Arman Barseghyan, director of Ameriabank's retail operations, the large-scale use of remote services in Armenia has no alternative, but it will take time.\nAccording to him, the success of wide distribution of remote services in Armenia depends first of all on the general well-being of the population. Thus, according to Barseghyan, such services are unavailable for a certain segment of the population, mainly, this applies to marzes, where the level of use of the Internet, smartphones and simply banking services is extremely low.\nAt the same time, Mihran Muradyan, head of the retail trade department of HSBC Bank Armenia, also believes that the future of banking activity in Armenia is connected with the use of digital technologies. According to him, in some countries, for example in Singapore, bank branches do not use human resources at all, and the work is carried out entirely in a digital format.\nAccording to experts, the development of technologies in the world has radically changed not only business, but also people, their lifestyle, habits and way of thinking. According to Vakhtang Abrahamyan, a member of the Central Bank of Armenia Council, digital technologies in the banking sector of Armenia are developing at the expense of the young generation, which cannot imagine its life without smartphones and gadgets.\n\"The banking customer of the 21st century, who quickly adopts new technologies, will demand new technologies, and banks will have to follow rapidly changing trends,\" he believes.\nAs Abrahamyan believes, these trends confirm the fact that 40 percent of bank customers in Great Britain have never visited a bank. \"All this shows the trend we are following,\" he added.\nThere is no progress without risk\nNaturally, the development of new technologies creates new risks, in particular, the threat of fraud and hacker attacks. The Central Bank of RA, as a regulator, pays great attention to the security issues of the banking system and products, including online banking. At the same time, all Armenian banks have internal rules, according to which banks are obliged to conduct \"penetration testing\" regularly (once every month or quarter). There are also international safety certificates.\nHowever, at the same time, there are risks, in any case. According to the analysis of information security expert Samvel Martirosyan, most of the Armenian banks have a quality system to protect against hacker attacks, but there are also more vulnerable banks. According to him, 4-5 banks are seriously vulnerable, as a result of which online-banking customers are in danger.\nAt the same time, he stated that, as of today, no serious hacker attacks have been registered in domestic banks.\n\"We are still not interesting for hackers, because the spread of online banking in Armenia is limited, and the online market of the republic is still small. However, the market will, of course, grow, and attacks may naturally begin,\" the expert says. Martirosyan also believes that the possible vulnerability of banks to hacker attacks is only a theoretical threat, but in any case, banks should take this into account.\nNon-bank actors are partners of banks\nThe development of digital technologies is ahead of time today, and the banking business does not have time to transform its activities in accordance with new realities and modern trends. That is why various non-banking institutions, in particular, payment systems, telecommunications companies, have started to provide financial services along with banks.\nAccording to many bankers, the new digital companies are creating significant competition in the main types of banking services, depriving banks of some profits. One such example is Google, which launched a plastic debit card. It's used by millions of consumers on Google Wallet. And PayPal ranks first in many countries in the field of providing online payment services. Apple Pay and other mobile banking and wallet services are worth mentioning.\nAccording to Maxim Khalmatov, director of information technologies of \"ArmenTel\" CJSC, the banking sector and telecommunication companies in Armenia will not compete in the market of financial solutions, but will become partners. The specialist believes that this will happen mainly due to the regulatory features of the existing market in Armenia, in particular, the activities of banking organizations and telecommunications companies, as well as the limited nature of the market.\nIn such conditions, the banking business will be preserved in its pure form for the limited segment and especially for the corporate and premium class, and the retail sector will be more dominated by combined products and services, where the bank and the non-bank actor will have respective roles in the customer service sector.",

Armenia's modern banking system is not ready for technological development, stated Tigran Jrbashyan, development director of Ameria group of companies, within the framework of the 3rd International Business-Innovation Forum in Dilijan.\n\"For the innovative development of the banking sector, large finances are needed in the absence of the necessary volume of the market,\" he said.\nThe expert believes that the banking system is on the verge of serious changes.\n\"In 2017, you will have a 'hungry', technologically underdeveloped banking system that has entered into competition with major global players, and it will have to invest more in technological development,\" he noted.\nJrbashyan also added that modern technologies lead to the fact that mediation services traditionally operating in various fields lose their relevance. For example, a service like Uber (a service for ordering a personal driver through an iPhone or Android application) replaces a traditional taxi service.\nHe also mentioned that access to financial resources is being democratized in the financial sector, and the existing institutions of financial intermediation are being urbanized (elimination of intermediaries).\n\"Not only in the world, but also in Armenia, the \"crowd lending\" phenomenon is gaining momentum, which allows bypassing traditional financial institutions to lend or receive a loan,\" said Jrbashyan.\nThe 3rd international business-innovation conference started on November 13 in Dilijan. The conference is attended by local and foreign businessmen, representatives of business unions and associations, state administration bodies, consulting companies, educational institutions, diplomats.\nThe event is held under the patronage of the Prime Minister of Armenia, Hovik Abrahamyan. The main sponsor of the conference is the BetConstruct company.\nThe first international business-innovation conference was held in Dilijan from November 29 to December 1, 2013. \narmbanks.am:",

        "title": "Innovative transformation will determine the future of RA banks",
        "content": "Exclusive interview of Artur Hambardzumyan, Head of Innovation and Quality Department of \"Ameriabank\" CJSC (continued) to \"ARKA\" news agency\nARCA: What role does technological development play in Armenia's banking system?\nA. Hambardzumyan: New technologies play a dual role in the banking system. On the one hand, they allow solving business efficiency problems by reducing cost and opening up new opportunities, on the other hand, they force banks to keep up with the times. As customer behavior and lifestyles change, banks simply have no choice but to change and change the ways and means of service. There is a certain segment of the market where customers cannot imagine their life without new technologies, but there is also a much larger segment to which these technologies are not available. That is why it would be wrong to claim that tomorrow we will completely switch to virtual service, which will become the only way to communicate with customers. It is necessary to take into account the so-called generational preferences and convenience, and for this, when switching to new technologies, banks should not forget about the large number of customers who are used to traditional methods of service and \"live\" contact. And as for the technologies themselves, since they open up great opportunities for banks, banks have to follow them to meet the needs of the new generation of customers who cannot imagine their life without modern technologies.\nARCA: At what level is the development of banking technologies in Armenia compared to other countries?\nA. Hambardzumyan: If we compare the technologies of Armenian banks with developed and developing countries, particularly Russia, we will notice that our banks are in the role of \"falling behind\". Of course, there were cases when certain products entered Armenia earlier than Russia, for example, the ArCa online service, virtual card payments, but in general, technologically, we are lagging behind. Let's take, for example, mobile banking services, which Armenian banks have just started to introduce, while in many CIS countries they have been actively developing for several years. Today, very few Armenian banks have mobile banking applications, which proves that we are currently in the role of the rear guard, trying to catch up with the leaders, rather than keeping up with the times. On the other hand, the figures show that the potential users of online and mobile banking services in Armenia today are relatively few. Of course, banks may argue that the market is not yet ready for mass implementation of remote banking services, but on the other hand, there was no quality offer. If mobile banking had been introduced earlier, it is possible that today the number of users would be several times larger.\nARCA: What is the reason for the technological backwardness of Armenian banks?\nA. Hambardzumyan: The problem is the existing infrastructure. In particular, the reason many of our banks are technologically underdeveloped is their dependence on certain banking solution providers. Thus, about half of Armenian banks use \"Armenian programs\" as their main operational system. Some banks, including large ones, use another local solution, Elsoft, and some use software developed by their own or their parent company. Our processing company is also to blame for technological underdevelopment. Although all the mentioned companies try to develop their solutions within the framework of their own agenda, in any case, certain conditions are created, due to which we are not able to respond to changes and introduce new technologies in time. Historically, a model has been formed where the freedom of activity in the IT sector depends on the pace of development of the suppliers available in the market. And the transition to large international suppliers requires large investments, for which banks do not have a large enough business. As a result, we find ourselves in a dead end: you will not buy the expensive one, because such costs are not justified, and the local one does not always meet the latest technological requirements. Thus, it is the technologies available in our banks that limit the entry of innovative products into the market. That is why the size of the business must be such that the bank can afford to innovate, and the market must be large enough to make these investments profitable. This is where we face the problem of expanding banks and searching for new markets. unless there are market opportunities, there will be no serious investment in innovation.\nARCA: Which technologies are in the greatest demand in the banking market of Armenia today? In that context, what new services can be introduced in the near future?\nA. Hambardzumyan: As for the service method, there is a segment that wants to be served easily and quickly, to solve all banking problems on the spot, at any time of the day, regardless of whether they are in the office or at the resort. Technologies are now moving in just that direction. Self-service systems such as internet banking, mobile banking, contact centers, ATMs equipped with new technologies and payment terminals are widely spread in Armenia today. Unlike us, in other countries these technologies have been used for a long time and have a large number of users. This is new for the Armenian market for now, but I hope that in 2-3 years remote banking systems will become one of the main ways of customer service. Today, payment instruments, e-commerce and online payment systems are developing quite quickly, our banks actively offer these services. The main competition is in the field of online payments. Today, one of the rapidly developing directions is payment instruments. It is hoped that in the near future personal payments will also develop, that is, money transfers from one individual to another individual using a mobile phone number or other means of identification. But in that business, the bank has to decide its role when, on the one hand, it just issues cards, and on the other hand, it acts as an infrastructure that acts as a gateway to online and mobile payments in the market. That is why the payment business will be widespread, and this will be the main form of transformation that will take place in the RA banking system.\nAccording to the results of the ARCA DigiTech 2015 business forum, Ameriabank was recognized as the innovative company of the year. What work has been done to achieve this, what advanced technologies have been implemented?\nA. Hambardzumyan, Ameriabank has been emphasizing the innovations I mentioned for several years. Moreover, the technological development of the bank was limited by the aforementioned factors, which did not always allow to introduce innovations. With all that, we tried to do everything possible to make it convenient for our customers and give them new opportunities to perform banking operations. \nOur main feature is a multifaceted approach, when the bank provides all possible forms of service for the client. We have introduced ATMs with the ability to deposit cash, created a contact center through which we not only solve customer problems, but also carry out banking transactions. A contact center is actually a virtual customer service tool over the phone that serves as a substitute for a bank branch. In March this year, we introduced mobile banking for IOS and Android, and recently also for Windows operating systems. it is fully integrated with Internet banking, which we introduced back in 2009. To say more, we have already managed to update our mobile application, add new functions and features. From the point of view of carrying out transactions, our mobile banking system is quite advanced, through it you can carry out any payment transaction and manage both card and current bank accounts. Instead of password generators, we have implemented a corresponding mobile application, Ameria Token. We have also implemented a card fraud monitoring service that allows you to automatically detect and block suspicious transactions around the clock. No matter where the client is in the world, no matter what problem he has, he can call us at any time of the day, and our specialists will answer all his questions. In addition, we are actively promoting virtual payment terminals so that e-commerce can develop in the country and businessmen have the opportunity to sell their services online. In other words, we are trying to improve the service of trading points. In our country, all this is just developing, and we try not only to provide all the mentioned services to our customers, but to do it first. That's why DigiTech recognized us as the Innovative Company of the Year.\nARCA: What does Ameriabank plan for the further innovative transformation of its activities?\nA. Hambardzumyan: We will continue to develop remote banking services, especially considering that our branch network is not so big compared to other large banks. However, the fact remains that for Ameriabank alternative ways of service occupy a priority place. It's not just mobile banking, it's also a full range of self-service tools, including fully self-service branches. Another direction of development is increasing our role in the market of real and virtual payments, cards and payment infrastructure. Recently, a new service was introduced that allows instant transfers from the bank's website from any card of the Visa, Master and Arca payment systems to an account or card opened in Ameriabank. This is a worthy alternative to quick money transfers, where friends and relatives living abroad can send money transfers from anywhere in the world to Ameriabank customers without leaving home. \nWe will do everything possible to make all new services available to all our customers in Armenia through advanced technologies, and Ameriabank will become the main market participant that will provide the necessary infrastructure for this. Of course, our market is small, and some things will reach us very late, because Armenia is not so attractive in terms of potential for large global markets.\nARKA: In your opinion, what is the competitive advantage of a technologically well-equipped bank today?\nA. Hambardzumyan: The most important competitive advantage will be the bank that will provide serious and advanced IT solutions. There is an opinion that banks are turning into IT companies. That's why today we are trying to find all the alternative solutions of our information and technological infrastructure that will provide flexibility, allow us to respond in time to customer demands and increase business scale. And so those banks that pay a lot of attention to investments in IT and innovation today will have an advantage in the long run.\n \nIt is very important that innovations in the banking system are not seen only in the context of customer service. When we say innovative transformation, we mean that it also refers to the technological development of the bank's internal systems, management methods and business processes, which in turn determine the degree of efficiency of the bank.\nARKA: Can legislative regulation promote the development of high-tech banks?\nA. Hambardzumyan: The Regulatory Body should support that process. Since 2015 since January, the Central Bank of Armenia is gradually tightening the regulatory capital requirements (according to Basel III). From 2018, all intangible assets, including IT investments, will be deducted from regulatory capital. And if we take into account that the threshold of the minimum regulatory capital has been raised to 30 billion AMD, the opportunities of small banks to invest in infrastructure are even more limited. As much as this new requirement corresponds to the international experience of banking regulation, it will not contribute to the growth of investments in the field of technology in our market. I think the regulator can still find some methods and forms of incentives. The question is not only the local market, but the ability of banks to participate in the global competition unfolding for the sake of the customer, because banking has long been global in nature. And for that, you need to have appropriate technological solutions. Of course, regulation is not the most important aspect of technological development, but it can both restrain the growth of investment and facilitate its inflow.",

The largest 5 banks together capture only 46 percent of the system, and the rest of the banks operate mainly in specialized sectors. Tigran Jrbashyan, Development Director of \"Ameriabank\" CJSC, stated this at a meeting with journalists, talking about the Central Bank's decision that the capital of banks will increase from 2017, and it will be set at 30 billion drams.\n\"The banking system of Armenia has no problem of monopolization, and mergers will definitely take place. Even if it weren't for the Central Bank's decision to revise the capital requirements, the merger would have gone on its own, there just wasn't the motivation. And now the owners are going to decide which is better: to merge and go through some processes or to wait until the bank suffers losses. The CB decision only accelerated that process,\" he said, according to \"Armenpress\".\nAccording to Jrbashyan, in the next two years there will be mergers and acquisitions, new players, banks with new status and opportunities will emerge, and this will lead to increased stability and efficiency. \"This process will be quite healthy and, I think, in 2017 we will have a banking system with other opportunities and other profitability indicators, which is ready to attract new capital and carry out financing,\" he said.\n\"Ameriabank\" CJSC director, general director Artak Hanesyan also mentioned that the capital indicates the stability of banks in difficult times. \"Increasing capital will, first of all, lead to increased stabilization, secondly, capital is the tool that gives skill to the further growth of the system. Currently, the capital adequacy ratio of banks is approaching the limit, which implies that we cannot develop further and lend to the economy without attracting additional capital,\" he emphasized. According to Hanesyan, many banks are now open and ready to merge, which will ultimately lead to an increase in efficiency. \"I think the optimal number of banks in Armenia is 10-12,\" he said.\nThe Central Bank of RA in 2014 adopted a decision on December 30, according to which, in 2017 from January 1, the minimum amount of the total capital of banks will be 30 billion drams, instead of the currently required 5 billion drams. The Central Bank conditioned its decision on the necessity of promotion and enlargement of bank mergers.",

        "content": "At this stage, the banking system is showing some caution in terms of lending, Ameriabank General Director Artak Hanesyan said at the press conference held today, answering the journalists' question. \n\"Basically, this caution is related to borrowers' creditworthiness assessments. Logically, servicing foreign currency loans becomes even more difficult due to these exchange rate fluctuations. But at the same time, not only by our bank, but I'm sure, by other banks, special programs are being developed on how to mitigate these phenomena for individual customers who are served with loans denominated in foreign currency. According to our experts, in the case of slightly extending the terms of various loans, creating such a situation that the borrower repays the same amount expressed in AMD, which he was repaying before the exchange rate change, can lead to easing the borrowers' burden of servicing the loan,\" Hanesyan said. \nAccording to him, banks today treat creditworthiness assessments more strictly, restraining possible future risks. As for the volume of lending in general, Artak Hanesyan said that on behalf of Ameriabank, he can state that they have not stopped lending, they continue. This year, Ameriabank's credit investments are expected to increase, not as much as last year, but growth is planned nonetheless. \nIn response to the journalists' question, Artak Hanesyan also referred to the policy of raising the refinancing rate by the Central Bank. When asked what effect this will have on loan interest rates, the CEO of Ameriabank answered: \n\"Of course, it was reflected. Of course, I think that it is a temporary phenomenon, it cannot be maintained at such a level for a long time, but it had an impact. Banks are Iranianizing the reserves in drams against funds raised in foreign currency and with an already increased interest rate, which, of course, had an effect on the cost of foreign currency deposits to increase. In other words, the interest rates that are publicly stated as the borrowing rate are actually higher on the bank due to other factors.\" \nAccording to Artak Hanesyan, the interest rates of loans should also increase automatically so that banks can maintain their minimum effectiveness level. \"Therefore, in the near future we will also notice a slight increase in the interest rates of foreign currency denominated loans. But on the other hand, due to very little increase in dram-denominated loan interest rates, deposit interest rates have increased comparatively more. Now, the interest rates of deposits expressed in drams, both short-term and long-term, compared to the same period last year, have increased quite a bit, if I'm not mistaken, at least 4-5 percent. This closes the possible increase in the interest rates of dram lending,\" said the General Director of Ameriabank.\nwww.lragir.am",

        "content": "YEREVAN, FEBRUARY 17, ARMENPRESS. Today, the efficiency index of the banking system in Armenia is quite low, therefore the further development of banks will depend on the increase in efficiency. Banks with low performance will find it difficult to raise capital and face competition. Tigran Jrbashyan, development director of \"Ameriabank\" CJSC, mentioned this during a meeting with journalists, presenting the indicators of the banking system of Armenia during 2014. Presenting for the first time in a new format, the management of \"Ameriabank\" summarized the results recorded not only by their bank, but by the entire banking system during the last 3 years.\n\"In general, the system has developed extensively in the past 3 years. Active lending has been driven by declining yields, as evidenced by several key financial indicators. Here, the assets/GDP ratio was around 75.8 percent, and the deposits/GDP ratio was more than 37 percent. We are still behind many countries in this, although there is some growth. Our assets are less profitable than in other countries,\" Jrbashyan said, according to Armenpress.\nThe development director of \"Ameriabank\" said that the most important indicator for attracting capital, the return on capital, is also at a low level in Armenia. \"If our neighboring countries are talking about two-digit numbers, in Armenia it is only 6.9 percent. In Armenia, the expenses of the banks \"eat\" most of the income, and the bigger the banks, the more the expenses decrease, which is natural, because in that case the expenses become more efficient,\" he emphasized.\nTigran Jrbashyan informed that the rate of development of the banking system in Armenia over the past 3 years has surpassed the rate of development of the gross domestic product (GDP), as a result of which the banks have achieved interesting indicators, in contrast to CIS and Eastern European countries. \"When we look at the most important indicator that shows the role of the banking system in the economy (loans/GDP indicator), in 2012 Armenia was inferior to most countries, and as a result of 2014 we already have an indicator of 47.7 percent. For comparison, I should say that it is close to the index of Russia and ahead of the index of Georgia,\" he noted.\nJrbashyan said that unlike in Georgia, where two large banks occupy almost 80 percent of the banking market, in Armenia the first 5 banks together occupy only 46 percent of the system.\nwww.armenpress.am",
