As a dedicated partner of My Forest Armenia, we consistently contribute to Armenia's afforestation, and this initiative marks another milestone in our enduring collaboration. In commemorating Aznavour's centennial, we're not just planting trees – we're nurturing a living monument that will grow and thrive, echoing the enduring impact of this legendary artist.  This piano evening will undoubtedly serve as a cornerstone in our ambitious vision to establish a 100-hectare green tribute,\" noted Mher Ananyan, Chairman of the Executive Board and CEO of AraratBank.\n“Charles Aznavour's legacy resonates deeply in the hearts of millions across Armenia, France, and beyond. Through this initiative, we're inviting everyone to be part of creating a living tribute that bears his name. This forest will stand as an enduring symbol – not just of his legendary artistry, but of our collective commitment to both our nation and our planet. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Aznavour Foundation and AraratBank for their quick response and generous commitment to this vision,\" said Andre Gumuchdjian, founder and director of My Forest Armenia. \n\"Charles Aznavour wasn't just an artist; he lived with universal concerns that were constantly reflected in his songs and interviews. Thus, in the song “La terre meurt” (The Planet is Dying), Charles Aznavour addresses Earth's pollution by humans and other environmental issues. As bearers and disseminators of his values, we at the Aznavour Foundation are convinced that environmental initiatives are extremely important and urgent. We enthusiastically accepted the idea of establishing the Charles Aznavour Forest and made the first investment. We hope that other organizations and individuals will also join this initiative,\" noted Kristina Aznavour, Executive Director of the Aznavour Foundation.\n\"AraratBank's commitment extends beyond concert sponsorship. Staying true to the corporate culture, our employees will actively participate in tree planting initiatives.

Ananyan, the Bank’s assets at year-end stood at AMD 403,497 million, providing a 12.9% growth over the previous year. The average annual growth rate of the Bank's assets within the last ten years is 12.4%.\nAs of the end of 2023, the Bank's liabilities stood at AMD 344,192 million, having increased by 12.8% or AMD 39,161 million over the previous year. At the end of the reporting year, term deposits stood at AMD 111,832 million or around 32.5% of total liabilities. At that, the increase in term deposits of individuals alone grew by 34.3%.\nIn 2023, the Bank's total loan portfolio made 49.7% of total assets versus 46.6% of the previous year, which is attributable to a rather high lending rate. The share of loans to individuals in the total loan portfolio increased by 1.2%, amounting to 48.5%.\nDuring 2023, AraratBank continued its intensive activities on the securities market as part of its investment policy, ensuring continued growth of corresponding indicators, and by the end of 2023, the Bank’s investment securities portfolio amounted to AMD 54,086 million, having increased by 5.0% or AMD 2,628 million as compared to 2022.\n\"Summing it up, it should be pointed out that in 2023, despite numerous economic and geopolitical challenges, AraratBank continued to progress sustainably, ensuring growth of its assets, loan portfolio, capital and revenues and expanding its cooperation with international partners,\" noted Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Board of AraratBank Mher Ananyan.\nFor the second year running, in addition to financial indicators, the General Annual Meeting оf Shareholders of AraratBank has included on its agenda the non-financial indicators – the social projects.\nIn 2023, the Bank implemented 11 social projects within the scope of its corporate social responsibility, highlighting, addressing and resolving a wide range of educational, health, environmental and social issues.

The Bank will donate children's prayer books to beneficiary children of the City of Smile Foundation.\nAraratBank has been cooperating with the City of Smile Charitable Foundation for years already, joining the Foundation in its efforts to treat children with cancer.\nThe prayer book is intended for children around 5 to 8 years old. From the child’s earliest years, the cognitive attribute of the relationship between the parent and the child is quite strong, and the child asks his mother plenty of questions, and it is the mother who acquaints the child with the world, provides answers and teaches him to pray in simple words.\n\"The idea of ​​creating a prayer book for kids came up in conversations with my son. In 2020, he broke his leg, and even the strongest painkillers didn’t give him relief from the severe pain after the surgery. My son asked me to pray for him, and I started to pray, and the faith was so great that the pain was gone. One day, when I suggested that he should pray himself, I realized that my child didn’t know how to pray for his needs. This is how the idea of ​​creating a children's prayer book was born. The book can become the first guide for children, the first prayer book that will teach them how to pray and, at the same time, to start a conversation with God. And since the conversation took place between my son and me, the book is narrated as a \"Conversation between a mother and her child,\" shares her experience Marianna Apresyan, Doctor of Theology, founder and president of Christian Women's Forum NGO. \n\"With this initiative, the Bank, under the Foundation’s auspices, stands by children fighting cancer and malignant blood disorders, promoting unity and hope. As a matter of fact, an intellectual team of eight employees, recently formed at AraratBank, participated in the \"What? Where? When?” charity championship a few days ago and directed the funds raised at the event to the treatment of children with cancer. This once again emphasizes the importance of the Bank’s commitment to social responsibility,\" notes Anna Allahverdyan, Advisor on Public Relations to CEO of AraratBank.",

Matenadaran needs a laboratory that will meet high international standards, because the manuscripts stored here for centuries are living things. The arising challenges cannot be addressed through conventional methods. New laboratories are being created around the world, new and strong laboratories equipped to provide a more efficient, sound and scientifically based storage of ancient manuscripts. Together with Matenadaran, we are trying to set up a modernized and re-equipped laboratory in the pursuit of national cause,\" said Chief Executive Officer of AraratBank Mher Ananyan.\n\"We have more than 60 years of expertise on restoration, yet manuscripts are exposed not only to physical, but also to biological and chemical damage, and that's why we have recently formed a Group of Biochemical Research of Manuscripts, which will work day and night on a study of the biochemical status of our manuscripts.\nIn no way should this cooperation between Matenadaran and AraratBank be taken as a mere provision of support by the bank to acquire the equipment that we need so much. Such cooperation has a strong moral voice and builds a positive momentum,\" noted Arayik Khzmalyan, Director of Matenadaran.\nThe unparalleled performance of the \"Avetis\" string quartet followed the official part of the event, marking the beginning of a new comprehensive cooperation.",

        "content_en": "On March 6, Mediamax Media Company and Skill Marketing Company held the first Robust Armenia conference on Sustainable Development and ESG: Global Agenda, Local Needs.\nAraratBank, a partner of the conference, was one of the participants in the panel discussion.  \nAccording to Environmental and Social Risks Officer of AraratBank Raisa Babayan, the Bank intends to develop and implement an ESG strategy that includes environmental (climate), social and corporate governance as three key factors for assessing the Bank's impact on sustainability and environment, society and internal governance structure.\nAraratBank started investing in greener Armenia in 2012, being one of the first financial institutions to sign an agreement with Green for Growth Fund (GGF) on financing energy efficiency projects. Over 12 years, AraratBank has enhanced its services and has prepared a skilled staff. An important component of the agreement was the provision of technical assistance that allowed for the implementation of green finance instruments and training of green loan specialists.\nZaruhi Melkonyan, Head of International Operations Department at AraratBank, said: \"The conference is an important platform particularly from the perspective of exchanging experience. Besides, the Bank, as a key link in the national economy, must have its say in shaping green Armenia.\"\nRecently, the Bank has implemented an important project with a focus on sustainable development, financing the purchase of around 100 electric cars, which are currently deployed as taxis.\n\"This will contribute to reducing the levels of harmful emissions into the environment,\" noted Vahan Gharibyan, Deputy Head of Corporate Business Lending Department at AraratBank.\nThe keynote speaker of the conference John Dee, who is a high-profile expert in the field of sustainable development, said: \"When you reduce your use of electricity, you make your business more profitable and more resilient and you have less impact on the environment.”\nRobust Armenia has been established as an annual conference to serve as a platform for discussion of Armenia’s sustainable development issues by representatives of the private sector.",

Both the first and the second films - \"The will to get back on your feet again\" and \"The will to get back on your feet again: self-cognition\" - are available on YouTube social media platform of ARARATBANK.\nThe core target audience of the first film “The will to get back on your feet again\" was school-age children, who were given the opportunity to immerse themselves in the underexplored chapters of the Armenian history and analyze the historical gaps with the author. The main message behind the film \"The will to get back on your feet again: self-cognition\" refers to the future and states the motto “Culture - Faith – Purpose”, which runs throughout the film and outlines the conditions for proper exploration of the Armenian history.\n\"The premiere of the film in May is not accidental as it was over these days that our nation recorded a number of historic victories and came together over a common purpose,\" the event organizers note.\nThe author and director of the documentary series, Vahe Sukiasyan, says that the idea of the film series was conceived in 2015, when he and the late historian Artak Movsisyan aspired to create a film series that would reflect the importance of preservation and clear record of national values.\nIn the second film, just like in the first one, the Honored Artist of Armenia Artur Karapetyan, assuming the role of a historian, unfolds and takes a closer look at episodes of history together with the audience.\nThe music for the film is written by musician, pianist Gisane Palyan and guitarist Karen Arzumanyan (“EmpYraY” rock band). The screenwriter is Lilit Barseghyan, and the chief producer is Narek Beglaryan, member of the Board of Directors at ARARATBANK.\nThe film has been shot within the frames of the corporate social responsibility program of ARARATBANK, from which the bank does not earn profits.\nThe pilot screening of the first film was organized in schools in a number of Armenian communities of Armenia and the Diaspora as an alternative method of presenting episodes of history. Subsequently, in cooperation with NCEDI Foundation, a methodical teaching manual was prepared based on the first film \"The will to get back on your feet again\", which will be introduced in general education schools of the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Artsakh, as well as educational establishments of the Diaspora, starting from this September.\n\"This is a unique partnership between the private and public sectors. We are happy that through our corporate social responsibility program we have made an investment in education, which is certainly one of the guarantees for a stable future,\" said Anna Allahverdyan, PR Advisor to CEO of ARARATBANK.",

Customers simply hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near a payment terminal to make a contactless payment. The service is available for iOS operating system users and NFC payments will not be long in coming for Android operating system users.\nCustomers simply hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near a payment terminal to make a contactless payment. Every Apple Pay purchase is secure because it is authenticated with Face ID, Touch ID, or device passcode, as well as a one-time unique dynamic security code. Apple Pay is accepted in grocery stores, pharmacies, taxis, restaurants, coffee shops, retail stores, and many more places.\nCustomers can also use Apple Pay on iPhone, iPad, and Mac to make faster and more convenient purchases in apps or on the web in Safari without having to create accounts or repeatedly type in shipping and billing information.

With this event, we aim to ensure that our employees feel confident about their strengths and believe that success lies in collective efforts, and that a successful teamwork equally depends on each of them, regardless of the task complexity. Besides, team building gives your employees a chance to socialize and get to know one another, which is equally important for further working relationships,” commented Mher Ananyan, Chairman of the Executive Board of ARARATBANK.\n\"Team building fosters a spirit of teamwork amongst employees, brings them together around a common goal. It is highly important that each employee has a clear sense of belonging to the team, and no matter what positions and ranks they hold, they all work and create on equal footing, during which new individuals, new managers or leaders are likely to come forward and either weak or strong points of teamwork are to be identified,” said Shushan Arakelyan, Head of the Human Resource Management Department of ARARATBANK.\n\"During the rebranding event hosted last year, we announced the launch of rebranding of branches. I am happy to say that we have met our targets for the year, and 23 branches have been rebranded so far. Moreover, 9 more branches are planned to be rebranded by the end of the year. 60 automatic teller machines and payment terminals have been also rebranded.\nI find it important to mention that the rebranding process implies not only external visual changes, but also increased efficiency of internal work processes, customer-centric service, staff training, as well as opportunities to generate and pursue new ideas,” said Suren Babajanyan, Head of Marketing and Banking Services Sales Department of ARARATBANK.",

        "content_en": "Please briefly state the reasons why the financial institutions in Armenia show interest in the international financial market. What are the challenges the market faces today?\nI can definitely state that, especially in recent times, the financial institutions in Armenia have been paying more attention to the global financial market integration, which is absolutely due to the high demand among customers. On the other hand, the field is path-breaking for the RA banking and financial sector, and in many cases, the participants of the sector may face industry-specific problems which require additional efforts to be solved. \nFrom the perspective of effective investment management, this topic is relevant and vitally important both for individuals and legal entities.\nOne thing is for sure: the trend we have today will affect positively the customers of the Bank as their financial literacy improves in line with the process of intensive integration with the system. These are the important factors that are fundamental to the development of the sector.   \nAs regards the challenges, they are largely interrelated with the macroeconomic stability and foreign policy in the country since this involves international relations. Financial institutions, especially the ones operating in the foreign market, should be careful in choosing partners given not only the stability of the partner but also the activities often determined by political and credit risks. In the financial sector, the lack of qualified managers in the team is obvious and very often represents an obstacle.\nIt is well known that the global financial markets have always captured investors by the variety of financial instruments and high liquidity. In addition to the financial instruments available in the local market, are our citizens provided with an access to the broad financial toolkit offered by the international market today and if so, how?\nToday we can say that the Republic of Armenia is home to the licensed companies which provide access to the services and a wide range of financial instruments available in the global financial market.\nIt is noteworthy that ARARATBANK has recently signed a new cooperation agreement, expanding the range of services provided in the global financial market and therefore providing access to around 5,000 top-performing financial assets: securities of over 12 countries, including shares listed on the most reputable stock exchanges in the United States and Europe, a number of commodities, currency pairs, stock indices and other financial instruments.\nAll ARARATBANK customers, who are ready to invest in the global financial market within acceptable risk exposure, may take full advantage of the instruments above through ARARATBANK TRADING PLATFORM, which is a safe and user-friendly trading platform with innovative solutions. It is available on Desktop and Web browsers as well as iOS and Android operating systems. As a matter of fact, our skilled employees are ready to support both beginner and professional customers in managing their funds efficiently.   \nWould you please highlight the advantages that make you stand out from other companies providing similar services in the market?\nTrust is, perhaps, the first and foremost circumstance, which I consider necessary to emphasize. The Central Bank of Armenia exercises control over the commercial banks operating in Armenia, including ARARATBANK. It should be noted that the regulatory body in our country - the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia - is guided by stringent control and regulation policies, which is an important indicator to have trust in banks.   \nAt that, the availability of banking services, professional team, multilingual customer service, competitive rates, and working across time zones are the important benefits for ARARATBANK customers. Moreover, each customer will have a personal manager to assist in managing invested funds skilfully and correctly.    \nIt is worth mentioning that improving financial literacy of the population is a key precondition for the sustainable and efficient development of the field. Moreover, the more comprehensible and simpler the information is, the more efficient and profitable the transaction of the customer will be. Our team provides information using understandable terms and simple language.     \nIn your opinion how much money on average does a beginning investor needs to start investing? \nThis is one of the most frequently asked questions, the answer to which is rather ambiguous. Beginning investors must first of all be sufficiently informed about the financial markets, have a clear knowledge of the risk/reward ratio and only then start investing. An investor can even manage an investment of 500 U.S. dollar efficiently if the latter possesses the required knowledge. Our team plays a major role in the vital processes of guiding customers properly, executing transactions accurately, and identifying the right solution for a problem.     \nGiven my professional background of over two decades in foreign and local financial markets, I assure that you can consider an average of 10 to 20 thousand U.S. dollars for the efficient management of a diversified portfolio. As I noted before, a number of factors, including but not limited to investors’ ideas and considerations, readiness to take a risk, should be considered before making any investment.\nIn this context, I would like to underline that the large volume of assets managed in the financial market can be easily diversified, reducing the impact of market risks on the investment portfolio.\nThe Internet is brimming with a variety of appealing offers. What should investors be wary of? Are all brokerage firms trustworthy?   \nThe Internet is indeed flooded with numerous appealing offers. However, the so-called \"unscrupulous brokers\", which are not licensed by the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia, are active in the virtual reality.  Brokers like these, as a rule, come up as legal entities registered in reputable companies in Europe, controlled by European or Australian regulators. As a result, services are provided to citizens through a company registered in an offshore country, which is definitely not regulated.    \nInsecure storage of funds, low liquidity of assets and open position frauds are the main risks our citizens often face.   \nBased on the experience of countries with enhanced financial systems, it can be stated that improving the financial literacy of population is the most efficient way to combat financial fraud. It is noteworthy that, in addition to providing investment services, our Bank is committed to improving the financial literacy of population.   \nToday, a number of large international companies provide services based on CFD contracts, which enable customers to increase the liquidity of investments paying low commission fees. Transactions in ARARATBANK TRADING PLATFORM are also concluded based on СFD contracts, which will in the end enable our citizens to execute transactions with a safety cushion at hand.   \nI find it important to emphasize that citizens should place trust only in the financial market participants, which are licensed by the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia. However, if they prefer the services provided by foreign companies, it is necessary to analyze the financial situation of the company, the field of regulation, and the documents to be signed very carefully.",

The camp was launched on July 1 at Monte Melkonian Military College in Dilijan. 225 children from all regions of Armenia joined the camp.\nAttaching importance to the development of IT sector in our country and education of children in that very sector, ARARATBANK has covered the participation expenses of the children of the Bank employees, who attend Armath engineering labs, and therefore have prior knowledge and basic skills in IT field.\n“Society perceives banks as institutions that lend and execute various financial transactions. It’s true, however, I must say that especially in recent years, banks have become quite active in implementing CSR programs that do not generate any profit. Today, more than ever, ARARATBANK is engaged in the implementation of CSR programs, acting as a socially responsible institution. I am happy to state that ARARATBANK financed the participation of our employees' children in the Armath camp - an investment of immense significance which I am positive will pay off in the future. It is our intention that this initiative should work contagiously on the financial and banking sector. We should all come to the realization that any investment in children's education will build a prosperous future for our country,” commented Anna Allahverdyan, PR Advisor to CEO of ARARATBANK.\n\"Our bank is a big family, where we take care not only about our employees, but also about our children. This is evidenced by the June 1 event organized by the Bank and the participation of employees' children in the annual Armath TechnoCamp, which was intended for older age group. These activities are also unique forms of non-monetary incentives for our employees. It is noteworthy that both the Head Office and branches located in Yerevan and regions are actively engaged in events regularly held by the Bank,” said Shushan Arakelyan, Head of the Human Resource Management Department of ARARATBANK.",

This innovative risk sharing program will make it easier for ARARATBANK to provide funding to youth, migrant, women and COVID-19 affected entrepreneurs, as losses on the loan portfolio will be carried by both parties.\nThe NASIRA program is a risk sharing facility for local financial institutions, supported by the European Union and MASSIF, the financial inclusion fund FMO manages on behalf of the Dutch government. It is a new way of unlocking support to underserved segments, specifically young, female, COVID-19 affected and migrant entrepreneurs.\n“In the longstanding relationship with FMO, ARARATBANK has proven to be a socially engaged bank, also demonstrated by their interest in the Nasira target customers. Especially in Armenia, with a large diaspora, this will also include returnees. These groups often remain underbanked due to high risks - both perceived and real - involved in lending to them, due to absence of collateral and credit history, among others. The guarantee program takes away this hurdle, by agreeing in advance to share possible credit losses. A technical assistance program is ready to support ARARATBANK in their plans to reach out to NASIRA target segments”,  stated by FMO press service.\n\"I am delighted that the years of eraned trust has today led to the signing of one-of-a-kind agreement. The NASIRA program stands out for its risk sharing where  ARARATBANK and FMO will jointly bear the risk of default on the loans to financially vulnerable businesses, enabling beneficiaries to establish and grow their businesses in Armenia. Another noteworthy feature of this program is that it is unprecedented also in the whole region․It’s no secret that banks avoid financing financially vulnerable and high-risk businesses. We are happy that ARARATBANK comes up with such an offer, as we highlight the importance of providing access to finance and equal terms for all borrowers,” said Mher Ananyan, Chairman of the Executive Board of ARARATBANK.\n,,In our longstanding relationship with ARARATBANK, signing the NASIRA loan portfolio guarantee is an exciting next step. By reducing the perceived and actual risk of financially underserved groups and COVID-19 affected businesses, FMO aims to contribute to reducing inequalities within Armenia and enhancing financial support to small businesses during the COVID-19 crisis and its recovery period,’’ said Huib-Jan de Ruijter, Chief Investment Officer a.i. of FMO.",

        "title_en": "International partnership network - the significant accomplishment of ARARATBANK",
        "content_en": "ARARATBANK is one of the banks with an impressive network of international partnership which — during many years of its activity — has concluded agreements with over 20 international financial institutions, having borrowed funds and having fostered the economic growth in Armenia.\nBanks.am has interviewed Zaruhi Melkonyan, Head of International Operations Department and Executive Board member, about the target directions of lending, successful international cooperation and achievements of the Bank. \nMs. Melkonyan, please give an insight into the international financial institutions ARARATBANK has been cooperating with for years. What are the benefits of international partnership?\nARARATBANK has been cooperating with international financial institutions since 2007. The first major achievement was the signing of two agreements with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) aimed at fostering international trade and financing the SME sector. Cooperation with such a reputable institution was binding since the Bank was gaining a certain position, recognition, and new opportunities were created for the latter. Further cooperation was quite efficient. Due to our diligent work and results reported over the years, we succeeded in signing a number of loan agreements with EBRD which were combined with technical assistance programs. At that, we managed to increase the limit for international trade facilitation program (TFP) several times. It is noteworthy that for the fifth year running the Bank has been given an honorary award by EBRD and recognized as the Most Active Issuing Bank in Armenia in the frame of trade facilitation instruments.\nIn 2008, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development became a shareholder of ARARATBANK and made its own contribution to the development of the Bank. The Institutional Building Program (IBP) was implemented for about two years within the framework of cooperation, during which almost all the subdivisions of ARARATBANK underwent relevant trainings, processes were brought in line with international standards, a corporate governance culture was rolled out, and risk management and evaluation processes were improved.\nAnother major accomplishment of the Bank was the cooperation with the European Fund for Southeast Europe (EFSE). It is no secret that small and medium enterprises are the pillar and backbone of Armenian economy and in this context this agreement was very important for us within the framework of which we also received technical assistance by improving a number of SME lending processes. We held trainings for our credit officers which later enabled them to carry out the process of lending to small and medium enterprises efficiently and at minimum risk.\nOver the years we have expanded the list of IFIs by concluding agreements with a number of development banks and funds, which are widely recognized around the world. At present, ARARATBANK actively cooperates with about 20 international financial institutions, such as the Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO), the German Investment and Development Corporation (DEG), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the World Bank (WB), the Black Sea Trade and Development Bank (BSTDB), the European Fund for Southeast Europe (EFSE), the German-Armenian Fund (KfW), the Green for Growth Fund, Belgium-based Incofin Investment Management, responsAbility Global Microfinance Fund, BlueOrchard Finance Ltd, the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) finance institution, the Eurasian Development Bank (EDB), and Symbiotics SICAV, to name but a few.\nThe international institutions above are the partners that contribute to the progress of the Bank with their knowledge and extensive background, provide technical assistance, which enables to develop the directions of SME lending and trade financing through the use of the best and cutting-edge international technologies.\nWhich lending directions are a priority for ARARATBANK? Why?\nARARATBANK is a universal bank that provides services to individuals and legal entities in almost all sectors.\nLending to micro, small and medium enterprises has always been a target direction for us. We also highlight the importance of mortgage lending, where we have a rich experience and have been involved in almost all Government programs. At this stage, we have diversified the scope of small and medium enterprises even more and have separate ad-hoc projects for women and youth. The goal is to ensure equality, equal opportunities, rights and healthy competition for all in the business environment.\nThanks to the flexible borrowing policy, at present we have the opportunity to lend to the agricultural production chain. Of course, the volume of agricultural loans is still inferior to other sectors. However, at present we are actively working to make it a priority sector. \nWhat kind of green lending projects are financed? Why is this direction especially important?\nJoining the global processes of combating climate change, the Bank focuses on developing the \"green economy\". The borrowers whose activities have a minimum negative impact on the environment and result in energy saving, reduction of CO2 emissions, use of renewable energy and roll-out of alternative technologies, to name but a few, have always been in the spotlight of the Bank.  \nThe individuals and businesses that are ready to make safe investments with no environmental damage through the acquisition of new equipment or solar panels, through the use of new building and construction and other technologies are considered a target sector. Using state-of-the-art technologies in their activities reduces the cost of borrower processes, thereby increasing a borrower's competitiveness in both domestic and foreign markets, while the reduction of the negative impact on the environment is the most important result.\nEach project is sure to undergo audit, in-depth and comprehensive analysis, and all potential risks and opportunities are identified.\nYou have mentioned that lending to female entrepreneurs is one of the important directions where the funds borrowed from international partners are used. What is the dynamics of women doing business in Armenia?\nWomen have always played a key role in the development of economy. Programs aimed at supporting women in business have always been at the forefront in the strategy of ARARATBANK. We try to involve women in the development of the Armenian economy as much as possible through our credit, business-education and business- literacy programs. Today, we have already many successful and inspiring projects that once again demonstrate the importance and benefits of engaging women in business. Along with the roll-out of the lending instrument, the Bank, jointly with the consultants involved, arranged numerous events aimed at enhancing women's entrepreneurial knowledge and skills, assisted in an accurate market research, developed a marketing strategy, helped to effectively organize business and financial management, understand competitive advantages, and provided an insight into tax legislation.  \nThe purpose is to support and encourage female entrepreneurs for them to be more active in doing business, and if they are not yet involved in any business, start doing it. It is noteworthy that the majority of businesswomen who are customers of ARARATBANK are involved in trade and service sectors.\nIf we present information in numbers, about 28% of corporate business goes to women and 11% - to the youth. Over 50% of the corporate business portfolio goes to the entities involved in trade, followed by the service sector, the share of which makes over 15% of the portfolio.\nHow would you assess the dynamics of lending programs? What new programs does ARARATBANK have in place?\nARARATBANK is involved in many Government programs, such as agricultural loans subsidy programs, mortgage lending programs, and programs to address the economic impact of the coronavirus.\nSpeaking of consecutive crises, I consider it important to mention that in the conditions of the pandemic, economic and post-war crises, in 2020 ARARATBANK managed to raise USD 5 million and EUR 3 million from two entirely new partner financial institutions, such as Triodos Investment Management and Microfinance Investment Facility, while, in early 2021, it attracted USD 5 million from another reputable international financial institution, BlueOrchard Covid-19 Emerging & Frontier Markets MSME Support Fund. The funds were intended to support local businesses, foster the SME sector and support MSMEs affected by Covid-19 in Armenia.\nAs to new projects, ARARATBANK is in the process of working out several new programs, which will be engaging and will stand out in the banking system, but we will keep it under wraps for a while. However, in the next two years, the Bank intends to increase the share of loans to female entrepreneurs to 12% in its total loan portfolio through additional allocation of funds for a total volume of about 10 million U.S. dollars.",

        "content_en": "Today, on 25 June 2020, ARARATBANK  wraps up the 2019 indicators at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in ARARATBANK  ZARGATSUM branch, reporting growth in the key financial indicators.\nMore particularly, as of 2019 the bank's assets stood at AMD 222,446 million, exceeding the indicator of 2018 by 0.7%. At that, lending increased by 13.3% and totaled AMD 135,921 million. In 2019, liabilities stood at AMD 185,042 million, while total capital — by 2019 indicators — stood at AMD 37,404 million. Net profit of AMD 2,264 million was reported.\n\"I believe that 2019 was a very important year for ARARATBANK  in terms of development. Despite the tough competition in the financial and banking sector, ARARATBANK  managed to accomplish the objectives set out in the bank's strategy during the reporting period. It is noteworthy that we expanded lending at the expense of retail, consumer lending, and highlighting the idea of a healthy and diversified loan portfolio, in 2019 we kept on pursuing a conservative and cautious credit policy and again stood out with а high-quality loan portfolio in the Armenian banking sector,” said Mher Ananyan, Chairman of the Executive Board of ARARATBANK  OJSC.\nHe informed that, in 2019, AMD-denominated bonds with a total volume of AMD 3.5 billion were placed for the National Mortgage Company RCO CJSC, while AMD denominated bonds with a total volume of AMD 2,5 billion and USD denominated bonds with a total volume of USD 2 million were placed for FINCA UCO, meanwhile performing the functions of a market maker of the said bonds.       \n“I find it important to report our success in the field of digital banking. In 2019, ARARATBANK  kept developing mobile banking through the application of cutting-edge solutions by redesigning the interface, adding new features, a new toolkit, introducing new loan and deposit products, and making the bank-customer relationships more user-friendly. By the way, it is noteworthy that by the end of 2019 the number of users reached 8184 compared to 402 in 2018, which, in my opinion, is quite a good indicator,” said Mher Ananyan, Chairman of the Executive Board of ARARATBANK OJSC.\n\"In addition to the figures reported in 2019, I consider especially important the role of the Board of Directors in the efficient management of the bank. I must say that in 2019 experienced, smart and knowledgeable members were added to the Board of Directors of ARARATBANK  who will use their full potential, experience and knowledge for the development and progress of the bank,” said Grigor Hovhannisyan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of ARARATBANK  OJSC.\nGiven that the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders was held under the conditions of COVID-19 pandemic,only the shareholders and management of the bank were present at the meeting, social distance was maintained, face masks and hand sanitizers were provided.",

Annual interest yield for AMD deposit shall be 9,41%, 4,76 for USD deposit, and 2,53% for EUR deposit. Interests shall be paid out every month. Minimum deposited amount shall be AMD 500,000, USD 1,000, and EUR 1,000, while maximum deposited amount shall be AMD 100,000,000, USD 200,000 and EUR 200,000.          \nArarat-Comfort will enable depositors to top up their deposits during the whole effective period of the contract except for the period of 90 days preceding the deposit maturity period.

Unlike other deposits, interest amounts shall accrue and paid out based on the following logic: where the deposit is reduced within the first 3 months, 0.1% per annum shall be paid for all currency deposits, and where the deposit is reduced between 3 and 6 months, 6.0% per annum shall be paid for AMD deposits, 3.0% per annum for USD deposits, and 1.5 per annum for EUR deposits. One of the most important advantages of the deposit is that where the depositor reduces the deposit 6 months later, all interests stipulated by contract shall be paid out to the depositor without any recalculation (reduction).",
